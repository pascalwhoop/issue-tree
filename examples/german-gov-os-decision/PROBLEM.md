# Problem: Operating System Choice for German Government

## Question
Should the German government use Linux or Windows as the core operating system for government workstations and servers?

## Context
Government IT infrastructure decisions have far-reaching implications for:
- National security and data sovereignty
- Long-term costs (licensing, support, maintenance)
- Interoperability with existing systems
- Vendor independence and lock-in risks
- Support for local IT industry
- Compliance with regulations and standards

This decision affects potentially hundreds of thousands of workstations across federal, state, and local government agencies.

## Success Criteria
A good solution should:
- Provide a clear recommendation (Linux, Windows, or hybrid approach)
- Be backed by evidence and analysis across multiple dimensions
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications
- Address practical implementation concerns
- Compare total cost of ownership
- Evaluate security and sovereignty implications
- Consider real-world case studies from other governments

## Notes
- Assume modern versions of both operating systems
- Consider both desktop/workstation and server use cases
- Include analysis of the transition costs if switching from one to another
- Consider the German government's stated goals around digital sovereignty
