# Problem Tree: German Government OS Decision

## Root Problem
Should the German government use Linux or Windows as the core operating system for government workstations and servers?

## Structure
This is a recursive problem-solving tree. Each node can either:
- Be decomposed into sub-problems (creates subproblems/ folder)
- Be solved directly (creates SOLUTION.md)

## Files
- `PROBLEM.md` - The problem/question at this node
- `STATUS.md` - Current status (pending/decomposed/solving/solved)
- `ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis and reasoning (created by solver)
- `SOLUTION.md` - The answer (created when solved)
- `subproblems/` - Child problem nodes (if decomposed)

## Usage
To work on this problem tree, use the solve-node skill:
```bash
cd german-gov-os-decision
# Then invoke: /solve-node
```

Or programmatically invoke the solve-node skill with this directory as the working directory.

## Current Status
See STATUS.md for current state: **pending**
