# Analysis: Government OS Migration Case Studies

## Problem Understanding

The question asks: What can we learn from other governments' experiences with OS decisions and migrations, particularly Linux vs Windows?

This is crucial for the parent problem (German government's OS choice) because real-world evidence often reveals gaps between theoretical benefits and practical outcomes. Historical case studies provide:
- Empirical data on actual costs vs. projections
- Technical and organizational challenges encountered
- Political factors that influence outcomes
- Success and failure patterns

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

I chose to SOLVE this directly because:
1. This is fundamentally a research task requiring literature review and synthesis
2. While multiple case studies are needed, they all serve the same analytical purpose
3. Breaking into sub-problems (one per case study) would fragment the comparative analysis
4. The synthesis of lessons learned requires viewing all cases together
5. I can efficiently research all required cases in a single comprehensive investigation

## Research Plan

I will investigate the following cases in order of priority:

### High Priority (Explicitly Requested)
1. **Munich's LiMux Project** (Germany) - The most relevant case: successful Linux migration followed by controversial reversal to Windows
2. **French Gendarmerie** (France) - One of the largest successful Linux migrations in Europe
3. **Barcelona** (Spain) - Recent Linux migration effort
4. **UK Government** - OS policies and approach

### Additional Cases (For Completeness)
5. **Italian Military/Public Administration** - Various Linux adoption efforts
6. **Valencia** (Spain) - Early Linux adopter
7. **Any other significant European examples**

## Research Methodology

For each case study, I will gather:
- **Timeline**: When did migration begin/end? How long did it take?
- **Scale**: Number of systems/users affected
- **Motivation**: Why did they choose Linux (or Windows)?
- **Technical approach**: Migration strategy and implementation
- **Outcomes**: What actually happened?
- **Costs**: Actual vs. projected costs
- **Challenges**: Technical, organizational, political issues
- **Current status**: Where are they today?
- **Lessons learned**: What succeeded? What failed? Why?

## Sources

I will use:
- Web search for recent articles and reports (2015-2026)
- Official government sources where available
- Technical reports and academic analyses
- News coverage from reliable technology publications
- Post-mortem analyses and retrospectives

## Expected Output

The SOLUTION.md will provide:
- Detailed case study summaries for each major example
- Comparative analysis across cases
- Identification of common success factors
- Identification of common failure causes
- Contextual factors that influenced outcomes
- Actionable lessons for German government context
- Assessment of applicability to current decision
