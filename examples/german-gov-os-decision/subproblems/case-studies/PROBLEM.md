# Sub-Problem: Government OS Migration Case Studies

## Question
What can we learn from other governments' experiences with OS decisions and migrations, particularly Linux vs Windows?

## Context
This sub-problem provides real-world evidence for the parent problem: "Should the German government use Linux or Windows?"

Multiple governments worldwide have attempted Linux migrations or made significant OS decisions. Their experiences - both successes and failures - provide invaluable empirical data about actual outcomes vs. projected benefits. This is particularly important because theoretical advantages don't always materialize in practice.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is evaluating whether the German government should adopt Linux or Windows as its core operating system for government infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Analyze Munich's LiMux project (Linux migration, then reversal to Windows)
- Review Barcelona's Linux migration efforts
- Examine French Gendarmerie's successful Linux migration
- Consider UK government's OS policies and outcomes
- Look at other relevant European/international examples
- Extract key success factors and failure causes
- Identify common challenges encountered
- Document actual vs. projected costs and benefits
- Analyze political and organizational factors
- Consider differences in context that affect applicability to German government
- Provide timeline and scale information for each case
- Draw actionable lessons learned

## Constraints
- Focus on large-scale government deployments (not small pilots)
- Prioritize recent cases (last 10-15 years) for relevance
- Look for well-documented cases with verifiable outcomes
- Consider both desktop and server migrations
- Distinguish technical issues from political/organizational issues
