# Sub-Problem: Total Cost of Ownership Analysis

## Question
What is the total cost of ownership (TCO) for deploying and maintaining Linux vs Windows across German government workstations and servers?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the financial dimension of the parent problem: "Should the German government use Linux or Windows?"

The German government is considering an OS choice that will affect hundreds of thousands of workstations and servers across federal, state, and local agencies. Cost is a major decision factor, but must be analyzed comprehensively - not just licensing fees, but all direct and indirect costs over a multi-year period.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is evaluating whether the German government should adopt Linux or Windows as its core operating system for government infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Provide specific TCO estimates for both Linux and Windows
- Include all major cost categories: licensing, hardware, support, training, migration, maintenance
- Consider both upfront costs and ongoing operational costs
- Analyze costs over a 5-10 year timeframe
- Account for scale (hundreds of thousands of workstations)
- Consider hidden costs (productivity loss, compatibility issues, etc.)
- Provide sources and methodology for cost estimates
- Address uncertainty and provide confidence ranges

## Constraints
- Assume modern versions of both operating systems
- Consider both desktop/workstation and server use cases
- Include transition/migration costs if switching from current state
- Use realistic estimates based on comparable large-scale deployments
