## History
- 2026-01-12: Sub-problem created from root decomposition
- 2026-01-12: Decomposed into 5 sub-problems (licensing, migration, support-maintenance, training-productivity, case-study-evidence)
- 2026-01-12: All 5 sub-problems solved; synthesized into comprehensive TCO analysis

## Sub-problems Completed
1. licensing-costs - Direct licensing and software costs (SOLVED)
2. migration-costs - One-time transition costs (SOLVED)
3. support-maintenance-costs - Ongoing operational costs (SOLVED)
4. training-productivity-costs - Human factors and training costs (SOLVED)
5. case-study-evidence - Real-world TCO data from government deployments (SOLVED)

## Synthesis Result
Synthesized from 5 sub-problems. Linux offers €1.0-2.6B savings over 5 years and €2.5-4.4B over 10 years in licensing costs, but these are partially offset by higher transition costs (€35-100M), elevated support costs during transition (€1.2-3.0B over 10 years depending on distribution choice), and training costs (€79-168M). Time horizon is critical: 5-year favors Windows, 10-year shows costs converging with Linux competitive or slightly advantageous.
