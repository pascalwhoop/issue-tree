# Analysis: Case Study Evidence Research

## Understanding the Problem

I need to find and analyze real-world case studies from government Linux and Windows deployments to extract actual TCO data. This evidence will validate or challenge theoretical cost models.

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a focused research task that can be executed directly:
- Clear methodology: search for documented government case studies
- Specific deliverable: compile TCO data from real deployments
- No need for sub-questions - all aspects (costs, timelines, challenges) come from the same case studies
- Research can be done comprehensively in one investigation

## Research Plan

### Priority Case Studies to Investigate
1. **Munich LiMux** (Germany) - Most famous German example, must include
2. **French Gendarmerie** - Large-scale Ubuntu migration
3. **Barcelona** (Spain) - Recent Linux initiative
4. **Italian Ministry of Defense** - Military deployment
5. **Other European governments** - Additional examples

### Data to Extract for Each Case Study
- Scale (number of devices/users)
- Timeline (start date, duration, current status)
- Total costs (if available)
- Migration costs
- Ongoing operational costs
- Cost savings vs projections
- Unexpected costs and challenges
- Success factors or failure reasons
- Lessons learned

### Search Strategy
1. Search for each specific case study by name
2. Search for "government Linux migration TCO"
3. Search for "government open source case study costs"
4. Look for academic studies and official reports
5. Include both successes and failures for balanced view

### Sources to Prioritize
- Official government reports
- Academic research papers
- Industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester)
- Technology news with actual data
- Post-implementation reviews

## Expected Outcome

A comprehensive compilation of 3-5+ case studies with actual TCO data, timelines, and lessons learned that can inform the German government's cost analysis.
