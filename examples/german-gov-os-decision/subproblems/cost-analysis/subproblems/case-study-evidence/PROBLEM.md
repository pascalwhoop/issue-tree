# Sub-Problem: Case Study Evidence from Government Deployments

## Question
What do real-world case studies from other government Linux and Windows deployments reveal about actual TCO outcomes?

## Context
Theoretical cost estimates must be validated against real-world evidence. Several governments and large public organizations have attempted Linux migrations or maintained Windows infrastructure at scale, providing valuable TCO data.

Case studies reveal actual costs, unexpected challenges, success factors, and lessons learned that pure cost modeling may miss.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify 3-5 relevant government Linux migration case studies
- Identify comparable Windows deployment examples
- Extract actual TCO data where available
- Note scale (number of devices/users)
- Document migration costs and timelines
- Capture ongoing operational costs
- Identify cost savings or overruns vs projections
- Document challenges and unexpected costs
- Note success factors and failures
- Consider geographic and cultural context
- Prioritize recent cases (last 10 years)
- Focus on European governments when possible
- Include Munich LiMux case (famous German example)

## Relevant Examples to Investigate
- Munich, Germany (LiMux project)
- French Gendarmerie (Ubuntu migration)
- Italian Ministry of Defense
- Spanish government (various initiatives)
- Other European governments
- Large US government agencies
