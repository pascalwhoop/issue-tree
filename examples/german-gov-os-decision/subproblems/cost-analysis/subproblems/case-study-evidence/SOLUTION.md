# Solution: Case Study Evidence from Government Deployments

## Answer

Real-world case studies from government Linux and Windows deployments reveal **significant cost savings potential** for Linux migrations, with documented savings ranging from €7 million to €30 million annually for large-scale deployments. However, case studies also reveal **critical success factors** and **political/organizational risks** that can dramatically affect outcomes. The evidence shows that well-executed Linux migrations at government scale (15,000-100,000+ devices) typically achieve **30-50% TCO reduction** compared to Windows, but poor execution or political interference can eliminate these savings.

## Evidence: Major Government Case Studies

1. **Strong Political/Leadership Commitment:** Schleswig-Holstein, French Gendarmerie show sustained political support is critical
2. **Phased Implementation:** All successful cases used gradual rollout over multiple years
3. **Minimal Training Requirements:** French Gendarmerie demonstrated this is achievable
4. **Custom Distributions:** Extremadura (Sysgobex), French Gendarmerie (GendBuntu) tailored solutions
5. **Digital Sovereignty Focus:** Recent migrations (2020s) emphasize independence from US tech companies
6. **Comprehensive Planning:** Italian Ministry included impact assessment, training programs
7. **Existing Hardware Utilization:** Linux's ability to run on older hardware provides additional savings

### Risk Factors and Challenges

1. **Political Interference:** Munich case shows political changes can reverse technical decisions
2. **Corporate Lobbying:** Microsoft actively contests government migrations
3. **User Acceptance:** Must manage change carefully to avoid user resistance
4. **Hidden Costs:** Poor implementation can add unexpected costs (NHS contractor charges)
5. **Project Management:** NHS NPfIT shows catastrophic failures possible with poor execution
6. **Contradictory Studies:** Microsoft-commissioned studies often contradict government findings

### Cost Overrun Risks

**General Migration Statistics:**
- 80% of data migration projects go over budget and fail to deliver on time
- Budget overruns of 30% common within first 3-4 months
- Main causes: overlooked costs, poor planning, lack of expertise, inadequate stakeholder engagement

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Detailed cost analysis including all direct/indirect expenses
- Training investment or experienced partner engagement
- Strong stakeholder alignment
- Treat migration as organizational change, not purely technical

## Geographic and Cultural Context

### European Government Trends (2020s)

Strong momentum toward Linux/open source driven by:
- **Digital sovereignty concerns** - reducing dependence on US tech companies
- **Budget pressures** - austerity measures driving cost optimization
- **Data protection** - GDPR compliance and data localization
- **Interoperability** - ODF standards adoption
- **Political support** - EU-level encouragement of open source

### German Context Specifically

- **Munich LiMux:** Cautionary tale of political risk, but recent reversal of reversal shows continued interest
- **Schleswig-Holstein:** Current success story demonstrating German government Linux viability
- **Federal level:** Germany has strong open source advocacy and technical capability

## Confidence Assessment

**High Confidence Findings:**
- Linux migrations at government scale (15,000-100,000+ devices) can achieve 30-50% TCO reduction
- Annual savings range €7M-€30M for deployments of 30,000-100,000+ devices
- One-time migration costs typically under €10M for 30,000 devices
- ROI achievable within 1-2 years

**Medium Confidence Findings:**
- Training costs can be minimal with proper planning
- User acceptance manageable with phased approach
- Political support is critical but can be volatile

**Low Confidence / High Uncertainty:**
- Exact TCO for German federal government (no direct case study at that scale)
- Munich true costs (contradictory studies)
- Long-term sustainability without political interference

## Caveats and Limitations

1. **Scale Differences:** Most case studies are 15,000-100,000 devices; German federal government may be larger
2. **Organizational Differences:** Military, police, and municipal governments differ from civilian federal bureaucracy
3. **Time Period:** Some case studies from 2000s-2010s; current Linux/Windows landscape has evolved
4. **Political Risk:** Munich demonstrates significant political risk to Linux migrations
5. **Incomplete Data:** Many case studies lack detailed cost breakdowns
6. **Self-Reporting Bias:** Government-reported savings may be optimistic
7. **Hidden Costs:** Some costs may emerge only years into deployment
8. **Reversibility Costs:** Munich shows reversal extremely expensive (€100M)

## Implications for German Government Decision

### Positive Evidence
- Multiple successful large-scale government Linux deployments in Europe
- Consistent evidence of 30-50% TCO reduction
- Recent German success (Schleswig-Holstein) directly relevant
- Strong European trend toward open source/digital sovereignty
- ROI typically achieved within 1-2 years

### Negative Evidence
- Munich case shows significant political and organizational risks
- Implementation quality critical - poor execution can eliminate savings
- Some hidden costs may not appear in initial estimates
- Reversal extremely expensive if unsuccessful

### Recommendations Based on Case Studies
1. **Learn from Munich:** Ensure sustained political commitment across electoral cycles
2. **Follow Schleswig-Holstein model:** Phased approach with strong political backing
3. **Adopt French Gendarmerie practices:** Minimize training requirements, phased rollout
4. **Plan for scale:** Italian Defense (100,000+) shows large-scale feasibility
5. **Budget conservatively:** Include contingency for 30% cost overrun risk
6. **Prioritize change management:** Treat as organizational change, not just technical
7. **Ensure irreversibility:** Design migration to make reversal prohibitively expensive (commit to Linux)
