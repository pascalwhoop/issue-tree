# Analysis: Licensing and Software Costs

## Problem Understanding

The question asks for direct licensing and software costs comparing Linux vs Windows deployment at German government scale:
- 500,000 workstations
- 50,000 servers
- 5-year and 10-year timeframes

This is a focused cost comparison question that forms one component of the larger TCO analysis.

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

I chose to solve this directly because:
1. **Specific scope**: The problem is well-defined - licensing costs only, not the full TCO
2. **Clear research path**: I can research Windows licensing, Linux support contracts, and productivity software costs
3. **Direct calculation**: Once I have per-unit costs, I can calculate totals for the given scale
4. **No natural subdivisions**: While there are multiple cost components (OS, office suite, support), these are best researched together to understand bundling and dependencies

Breaking this down further (e.g., "OS costs" vs "office costs" as separate sub-problems) would create artificial divisions and miss important bundling considerations.

## Research Plan

I will research the following components:

### 1. Windows Licensing Costs
- Windows Enterprise/Pro licensing per seat
- Volume licensing programs (Enterprise Agreement, government pricing)
- Windows Server licensing models
- Microsoft 365 Government pricing (includes Windows, Office, security)
- CAL (Client Access License) requirements

### 2. Linux Costs
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscriptions
- SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) subscriptions
- Ubuntu Pro/Advantage
- Community Linux (free) vs enterprise support costs
- Considerations for government support requirements

### 3. Productivity Software
- Microsoft 365 (Office, Exchange, Teams) government pricing
- LibreOffice (free, but support contracts available)
- Alternative office suites and their costs

### 4. Government-Specific Considerations
- Government volume discounts
- Multi-year agreement pricing
- Compliance and security certifications
- Support level requirements (SLA expectations)

## Information Sources

I will use:
- Web search for current 2026 licensing costs
- Government pricing information from Microsoft, Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical
- Industry reports on government licensing
- Case studies from other government deployments

## What I'm Looking For

- Per-seat annual costs for workstations
- Per-server annual costs
- Volume discount structures
- Total 5-year and 10-year costs at scale
- Comparison showing cost differential between Linux and Windows approaches
