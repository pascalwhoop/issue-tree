# Sub-Problem: Licensing and Software Costs

## Question
What are the direct licensing and software costs for deploying Linux vs Windows across German government infrastructure?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the most visible cost component of the TCO analysis. While Linux is "free" in terms of licensing, enterprise deployments often include commercial support contracts. Windows has clear per-seat licensing costs but may include bundled benefits.

Understanding the licensing cost differential is essential for the parent cost analysis, as it represents a recurring annual expense that scales with the number of deployments.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale (hundreds of thousands of workstations and servers).

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Provide specific licensing cost estimates for Windows (per seat/device)
- Identify Linux support contract costs (e.g., Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu Advantage)
- Consider volume licensing and government pricing
- Calculate costs for both workstation and server deployments
- Include associated software costs (Office suites, productivity tools)
- Consider multi-year licensing agreements
- Provide per-device annual costs and total costs at scale
- Include sources for pricing information
- Address different licensing models (subscription vs perpetual)

## Scale Parameters
- Assume ~500,000 workstations across all government levels
- Assume ~50,000 servers
- Consider 5-year and 10-year timeframes
