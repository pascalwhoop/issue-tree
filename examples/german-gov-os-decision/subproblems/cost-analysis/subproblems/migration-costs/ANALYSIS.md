# Analysis: Migration and Transition Costs

## Understanding the Problem

The question asks for one-time migration costs for German government systems transitioning to either:
1. **Linux** (from current mixed Windows/Linux environment)
2. **Windows** (standardizing current mixed environment)

**Scale**: 500,000 workstations, 50,000 servers

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This problem is specific enough to answer through direct research:
- Clear scope: migration costs only (not ongoing costs)
- Defined scale: 500K workstations, 50K servers
- Well-understood domain: many governments have performed similar migrations
- Specific deliverables: cost per seat and total costs with real examples

Breaking this down further into sub-problems (e.g., "application migration costs", "training costs", "hardware costs") would not add value - these components can be researched and estimated together as part of comprehensive migration cost analysis.

## Research Plan

### 1. Find Real-World Government Migration Examples
- Munich's LiMux project (Linux migration and later reversal)
- Other European government OS migrations
- US federal/state government migrations
- Document costs, timelines, lessons learned

### 2. Research Migration Cost Components
- Project planning and management
- Application compatibility analysis and remediation
- Data migration and system reconfiguration
- Pilot programs and testing
- Training and change management
- Hardware upgrades (if needed)
- Consulting and integration services
- Compatibility layer costs (Wine, virtualization)
- Rollout coordination and support

### 3. Industry Estimates and Methodology
- Gartner, Forrester, IDC migration cost models
- IT industry benchmarks for OS migration
- Per-seat migration cost ranges

### 4. Calculate Scenarios
- **Scenario A**: Current mixed → Standardized Linux
- **Scenario B**: Current mixed → Standardized Windows

### 5. Provide Cost Breakdown
- Workstation migration costs
- Server migration costs
- Total one-time costs
- Per-seat costs
- Timeline estimates

## Expected Sources
- Academic studies on government IT migrations
- Industry analyst reports
- Government audit reports
- Case studies from Munich, French Gendarmerie, Barcelona, etc.
- Technology consulting firms' migration frameworks
