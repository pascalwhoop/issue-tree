# Sub-Problem: Migration and Transition Costs

## Question
What are the one-time migration and transition costs for moving German government systems from their current state to either Linux or Windows?

## Context
Migration costs represent a significant upfront investment that can influence the OS decision. These costs include technical migration work, data transfer, system reconfiguration, application adaptation, pilot programs, and rollout coordination.

The German government likely has a mix of Windows and some Linux systems currently. Understanding what it takes to standardize on either platform is crucial for the TCO calculation.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate costs for migrating from current mixed environment to Linux
- Estimate costs for migrating/standardizing on Windows
- Include application migration/compatibility costs
- Account for data migration and system reconfiguration
- Consider pilot programs and phased rollout costs
- Include consulting and integration services
- Estimate timeline and resource requirements
- Consider compatibility layer costs (Wine, virtualization, etc.)
- Provide per-seat migration costs and total costs
- Include real-world migration examples from other governments
- Address both workstation and server migration

## Scale Parameters
- Assume ~500,000 workstations
- Assume ~50,000 servers
- Assume current state is primarily Windows with some Linux servers
