# Sub-Problem: Support and Maintenance Costs

## Question
What are the ongoing support and maintenance costs for operating Linux vs Windows infrastructure at German government scale?

## Context
After deployment, systems require continuous support, updates, security patches, helpdesk services, and IT staff. These ongoing operational costs often exceed initial licensing costs over a multi-year period.

Support costs differ significantly between Linux and Windows due to different support models, internal expertise requirements, vendor ecosystems, and maintenance practices.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate annual IT support staff costs for each OS
- Include helpdesk and user support costs
- Account for system administration and maintenance
- Consider security patch management costs
- Include update and upgrade cycles
- Estimate external vendor support costs
- Consider IT staff skill requirements and availability
- Account for both centralized and distributed support models
- Provide annual per-device support costs
- Compare support burden between the two platforms
- Include evidence from existing large-scale deployments
- Address both workstation and server support

## Scale Parameters
- Assume ~500,000 workstations
- Assume ~50,000 servers
- Consider 5-year and 10-year timeframes
- Assume professional enterprise support levels
