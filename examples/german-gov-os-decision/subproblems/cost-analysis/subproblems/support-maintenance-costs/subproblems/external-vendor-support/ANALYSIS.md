# Analysis: External Vendor Support Costs

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks for a comparison of external vendor support costs between Linux and Windows for German government deployment at massive scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a specific, focused research question that can be answered directly through:
1. Researching commercial support contract pricing for Windows (Microsoft Premier/Unified Support)
2. Researching commercial support contract pricing for Linux (Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical)
3. Comparing enterprise support models and SLA structures
4. Examining German market-specific pricing and vendor availability
5. Calculating costs at the specified scale

Breaking this down further would not add value - the research can be conducted directly.

## Research Plan

1. **Windows Support Options**:
   - Microsoft Premier Support / Unified Support pricing
   - Per-incident support costs
   - Enterprise Agreement support tiers
   - German-based support availability

2. **Linux Support Options**:
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) support subscriptions
   - SUSE Linux Enterprise support contracts
   - Ubuntu Pro/Advantage support
   - German vendors (e.g., Univention, local system integrators)

3. **Support Models**:
   - Per-device vs per-incident pricing
   - SLA tiers (standard, premium, mission-critical)
   - Business hours vs 24/7 support
   - Response time guarantees

4. **German Government Considerations**:
   - German-language support requirements
   - Local vendor availability
   - Public sector discounts
   - Compliance and data sovereignty requirements

5. **Scale Calculations**:
   - Calculate total annual support costs for 500K workstations
   - Calculate total annual support costs for 50K servers
   - Compare total external support expenditures

## Sources to Research

- Microsoft enterprise support pricing documentation
- Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical enterprise support pricing
- Public sector procurement data from German government IT projects
- Industry analyst reports on enterprise support costs
- Case studies from large European government deployments

## Expected Findings

I expect to find:
- Windows has structured Microsoft support tiers with per-device or EA-based pricing
- Linux support varies by distribution with per-subscription pricing
- Premium support levels have significantly higher costs
- German government scale should qualify for volume discounts
- Linux may have lower per-device support costs but require multiple vendor relationships
