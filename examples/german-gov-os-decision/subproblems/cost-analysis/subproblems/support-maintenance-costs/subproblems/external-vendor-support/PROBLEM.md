# Sub-Problem: External Vendor Support Costs

## Question
What are the external vendor support and commercial support contract costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale?

## Context
Beyond internal IT staff, organizations often rely on external vendor support contracts, commercial support providers, consulting services, and professional services. These external costs provide additional expertise, guaranteed SLAs, priority support, and specialized assistance.

External support costs differ between Linux and Windows due to:
- Windows has built-in Microsoft support options
- Linux requires third-party commercial support (Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, etc.)
- Different support models and SLA structures
- Varying availability of German-language support
- Different consulting rates and vendor ecosystems

This sub-problem contributes to the parent problem (support and maintenance costs) by quantifying external vendor and support contract costs.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is estimating ongoing support and maintenance costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify typical commercial support options for each OS
- Estimate annual support contract costs per device
- Compare Microsoft support vs Linux vendor support offerings
- Include premium support and SLA-based pricing
- Account for German government-specific requirements
- Consider consulting and professional services costs
- Estimate incident-based support costs
- Include support for specialized workloads or configurations
- Compare support coverage and response times
- Provide evidence from actual enterprise support contracts
- Address both ongoing support contracts and ad-hoc consulting

## Scale Parameters
- 500,000 workstations
- 50,000 servers
- Enterprise/government-grade support levels
- German market pricing and vendors
