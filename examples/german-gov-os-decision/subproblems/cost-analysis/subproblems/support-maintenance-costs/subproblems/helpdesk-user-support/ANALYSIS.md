# Analysis: Helpdesk and End-User Support Costs

## Problem Understanding

The question asks for helpdesk and end-user support costs comparing Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale (500,000 workstations).

Key factors to research:
1. Helpdesk ticket volumes per OS
2. Average resolution times
3. Staffing requirements (tier 1 and tier 2)
4. German IT support staff salaries
5. Incident rates comparison
6. Impact of user familiarity on ticket volumes
7. Learning curve costs for Linux transitions

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a specific, focused problem that can be answered through direct research:
- Enterprise helpdesk benchmarks are available
- OS incident rate comparisons exist from large deployments
- German IT salary data is accessible
- Staffing ratio calculations are straightforward

While complex, this doesn't need decomposition - it needs systematic research and calculation.

## Research Plan

1. **Helpdesk Industry Benchmarks**:
   - Typical ticket volumes per user per year
   - Average resolution times
   - Staffing ratios (users per helpdesk staff)
   - Tier 1 vs Tier 2 distribution

2. **OS-Specific Incident Rates**:
   - Windows vs Linux ticket volume comparisons
   - Studies from government/enterprise Linux migrations
   - User familiarity impact on support loads

3. **German Labor Costs**:
   - IT support specialist salaries
   - Total employment costs (social security, benefits)
   - Regional variations

4. **Migration/Transition Costs**:
   - Initial learning curve support spike
   - Long-term steady-state support levels

5. **Real-World Case Studies**:
   - Munich LiMux project support data
   - Other European government Linux deployments
   - Enterprise Linux desktop support experiences

## Expected Outputs

- Ticket volume estimates per OS
- Staffing requirements and costs
- Annual per-user support costs
- Confidence levels and assumptions
- Evidence from comparable deployments
