# Sub-Problem: Helpdesk and End-User Support Costs

## Question
What are the helpdesk and end-user support costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale?

## Context
Helpdesk and end-user support represent significant ongoing operational costs. End users encounter issues, need assistance, and require training on their operating systems and applications.

Support costs vary between Linux and Windows due to:
- Different user familiarity levels (Windows generally more familiar)
- Varying incident rates and ticket volumes
- Different complexity of common issues
- Desktop environment differences
- Application compatibility and user experience factors

This sub-problem contributes to the parent problem (support and maintenance costs) by quantifying the costs of supporting end users on each platform.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is estimating ongoing support and maintenance costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate helpdesk ticket volumes for each OS
- Calculate average resolution time per ticket
- Provide helpdesk staffing requirements
- Include helpdesk staff salary costs in Germany
- Estimate annual cost per user for helpdesk support
- Compare incident rates between Linux and Windows
- Consider user learning curve and adaptation costs
- Account for both tier 1 and tier 2 support
- Include remote support and on-site support costs
- Provide evidence from existing large-scale deployments
- Address impact of user training on support costs

## Scale Parameters
- 500,000 workstation users
- Professional office worker environment
- German labor market and salary data
- Enterprise support quality standards
