# Sub-Problem: IT Staff and Administration Costs

## Question
What are the IT staff and system administration costs for managing Linux vs Windows infrastructure at German government scale?

## Context
Internal IT staff represent one of the largest ongoing cost components in any enterprise IT environment. This includes system administrators, engineers, DevOps staff, and specialized technical personnel who maintain and operate the infrastructure.

The staffing requirements differ between Linux and Windows due to:
- Different administrative tools and automation capabilities
- Varying skill availability and salary levels in the German market
- Different complexity levels for routine administration tasks
- Varying staff-to-device ratios based on OS manageability

This sub-problem contributes to the parent problem (support and maintenance costs) by quantifying the internal human resource costs required to operate each platform.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is estimating ongoing support and maintenance costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate required number of IT staff for each OS
- Provide average salary costs for relevant IT roles in Germany
- Calculate staff-to-device ratios for both workstations and servers
- Account for different skill levels required (junior, mid, senior)
- Consider skill availability and hiring difficulty in German market
- Include system administrators, engineers, and DevOps roles
- Compare automation capabilities and their impact on staffing needs
- Estimate annual staff costs for both platforms
- Provide evidence from comparable large-scale deployments
- Address both steady-state operations and project work

## Scale Parameters
- 500,000 workstations
- 50,000 servers
- Enterprise-grade operations
- German labor market and salary data
