# Analysis: Patch Management and Update Costs

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks for a comprehensive comparison of patch management costs between Linux and Windows at German government scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

Key cost factors to investigate:
1. **Patch frequency and volume**: How many patches per year for each OS
2. **Testing and validation effort**: Pre-deployment testing requirements
3. **Infrastructure costs**: Patch management tools and systems (WSUS, Red Hat Satellite, etc.)
4. **Deployment effort**: Staff time for rolling out patches
5. **Downtime and reboot requirements**: Productivity impact
6. **Emergency security patches**: Urgent vs. routine update cycles
7. **Major version upgrades**: Cost and frequency of OS version upgrades
8. **Rollback complexity**: Handling failed patches

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a specific, quantifiable research question. I can directly research:
- Industry data on patch volumes
- Enterprise patch management case studies
- Tool costs and staffing models
- Government and enterprise best practices

Breaking this down further would create artificial subdivisions without adding clarity.

## Research Plan

1. Research Windows patch management at scale
   - Patch Tuesday cycle and volumes
   - WSUS/SCCM infrastructure costs
   - Testing requirements and timelines
   - Reboot requirements

2. Research Linux patch management at scale
   - Update frequencies for enterprise distributions (RHEL, SLES, Ubuntu)
   - Management tools (Satellite, Landscape, Zypper)
   - Testing practices
   - Live patching capabilities

3. Find enterprise case studies and benchmarks
   - Large-scale government deployments
   - Patch management staffing ratios
   - Cost per device estimates

4. Calculate total annual costs for both scenarios
