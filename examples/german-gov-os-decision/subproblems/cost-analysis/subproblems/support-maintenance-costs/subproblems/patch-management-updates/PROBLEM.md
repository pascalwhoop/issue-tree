# Sub-Problem: Patch Management and Update Costs

## Question
What are the costs for patch management, security updates, and version upgrades for Linux vs Windows at German government scale?

## Context
Security patching and system updates are critical ongoing operational tasks. Both operating systems require regular security patches, bug fixes, and periodic major version upgrades. However, the frequency, complexity, and testing requirements differ significantly.

Patch management costs differ between Linux and Windows due to:
- Different update frequencies and patch cycles
- Varying testing and validation requirements
- Different rollback complexity
- Downtime and reboot requirements
- Update infrastructure and tooling costs

This sub-problem contributes to the parent problem (support and maintenance costs) by quantifying the operational burden and costs of keeping systems secure and up-to-date.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is estimating ongoing support and maintenance costs for Linux vs Windows at German government scale (500K workstations, 50K servers).

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate annual patch/update volumes for each OS
- Calculate testing and validation effort required
- Include costs of patch management infrastructure
- Estimate staff time for patch deployment and monitoring
- Account for emergency security patches vs routine updates
- Consider major version upgrade costs and frequency
- Include downtime costs and reboot requirements
- Compare update reliability and rollback needs
- Estimate annual per-device patch management costs
- Provide evidence from enterprise patch management practices
- Address both workstation and server patching differences

## Scale Parameters
- 500,000 workstations
- 50,000 servers
- High security requirements (government context)
- Enterprise patch management infrastructure
