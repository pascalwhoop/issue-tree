# Sub-Problem: Training and Productivity Costs

## Question
What are the training costs and productivity impacts associated with deploying Linux vs Windows in German government agencies?

## Context
Human factors represent hidden but significant costs in OS transitions. Switching operating systems requires retraining staff, adapting workflows, and accepting temporary productivity loss during the learning curve.

Even staying with Windows may require training for version upgrades. The difference in training burden and productivity impact between the two options affects the TCO significantly.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Linux vs Windows for German government deployment at scale.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Estimate training costs per employee for Linux transition
- Estimate training costs for Windows (baseline or upgrade)
- Consider different user skill levels (basic users, power users, IT staff)
- Quantify productivity loss during transition period
- Account for learning curve duration and impact
- Consider change management and organizational resistance
- Include training materials development costs
- Estimate ongoing training needs
- Consider user satisfaction and adoption challenges
- Provide evidence from real government transitions
- Address both end-user and IT administrator training

## Scale Parameters
- Assume ~500,000 government employees as end users
- Assume ~10,000 IT staff members
- Consider phased rollout over 2-3 years
- Account for varying levels of technical expertise
