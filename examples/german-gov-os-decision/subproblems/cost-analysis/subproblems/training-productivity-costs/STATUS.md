## Summary
Analyzed training and productivity costs for Linux vs Windows deployment at German government scale (500K employees, 10K IT staff). Linux migration costs €132-275M in human capital compared to €53-107M for Windows baseline, primarily due to deeper learning curves, comprehensive IT retraining needs, and longer productivity recovery periods. Evidence drawn from Munich LiMux and French Gendarmerie case studies, industry training benchmarks, and productivity research.
