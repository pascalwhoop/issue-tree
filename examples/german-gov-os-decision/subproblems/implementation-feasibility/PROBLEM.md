# Sub-Problem: Implementation Feasibility and Strategy

## Question
What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the implementation dimension of the parent problem: "Should the German government use Linux or Windows?"

Even if one OS is clearly superior on paper, poor implementation can lead to failure. This sub-problem examines the practical aspects of actually deploying an OS choice across a large, complex, multi-level government organization with diverse needs and existing investments.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is evaluating whether the German government should adopt Linux or Windows as its core operating system for government infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify key implementation challenges (technical, organizational, political)
- Assess change management requirements at scale
- Evaluate training needs for IT staff and end users
- Consider support infrastructure requirements (help desk, documentation, etc.)
- Propose realistic rollout strategy (phased, pilot-first, big-bang, etc.)
- Assess timeline for full migration (if migrating)
- Identify critical success factors
- Consider governance and coordination across federal/state/local levels
- Evaluate risk mitigation strategies
- Address user resistance and adoption issues
- Consider contingency plans and rollback options
- Assess required expertise and staffing
- Draw on lessons from case studies about implementation approaches

## Constraints
- Consider the multi-level structure of German government (federal, state, local)
- Assume heterogeneous current environment (not all agencies start from same state)
- Focus on practical feasibility, not just theoretical optimal approaches
- Consider political and organizational realities, not just technical factors
