## History
- 2026-01-12: Sub-problem created from root decomposition
- 2026-01-12: Decomposed into 5 sub-problems (technical-migration-challenges, change-management, training-skills-development, deployment-strategy, risk-mitigation)
- 2026-01-12: Synthesized from 5 solved sub-problems into comprehensive implementation feasibility assessment

## Sub-Problems Completed
1. technical-migration-challenges - ✓ Solved: Technical challenges significant but solvable; application-first migration critical
2. change-management - ✓ Solved: Organizational readiness moderate-to-good; 30-40% budget to change management essential
3. training-skills-development - ✓ Solved: Training achievable at scale with 80-120M EUR investment over 2-3 years
4. deployment-strategy - ✓ Solved: 7-10 year phased pilot-first approach required for Linux migration
5. risk-mitigation - ✓ Solved: Comprehensive risk mitigation essential; organizational risks primary, not technical

## Synthesis Summary
Comprehensive implementation feasibility analysis concludes OS migration is TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE but ORGANIZATIONALLY CHALLENGING. Linux migration requires 7-10 years with €300-400M+ investment but aligns with digital sovereignty goals (French Gendarmerie 103K workstations, Schleswig-Holstein 30K workstations prove viability). Windows standardization operationally easier (3-5 years) but perpetuates vendor lock-in. Critical success factors: sustained political commitment, 30-40% budget to change management, application-first migration, comprehensive training, multi-tier pilots with go/no-go gates, acceptance of hybrid outcomes (70-80% Linux, 20-30% Windows retention). Munich LiMux lesson: organizational execution matters more than technical feasibility. 2025-2029 window represents unique opportunity with unprecedented political alignment.
