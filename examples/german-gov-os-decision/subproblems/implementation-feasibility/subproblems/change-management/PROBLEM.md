# Sub-Problem: Change Management and Organizational Readiness

## Question
How should the German government manage organizational change for OS migration or standardization across federal, state, and local government entities, and what are the key organizational readiness requirements?

## Context
This sub-problem examines the organizational and political dimensions of implementation. Large-scale IT changes fail more often due to organizational resistance and poor change management than due to technical problems.

The parent problem asks: "What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?"

Change management is critical because:
- German government has complex multi-level structure (federal, state, local) with varying autonomy
- Different agencies have different cultures, priorities, and political environments
- User resistance can derail technically sound implementations
- Coordination across hundreds of entities requires clear governance
- Political considerations affect decision-making and resource allocation

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify key stakeholders and their concerns across government levels
- Propose governance structures for coordinating OS decisions across federal/state/local levels
- Assess strategies for building buy-in and managing resistance
- Evaluate communication strategies for different audiences (executives, IT staff, end users)
- Address political considerations and decision-making processes
- Consider cultural readiness and change capacity
- Assess decision-making authority and autonomy at different government levels
- Examine coordination mechanisms between entities
- Draw on change management frameworks and best practices
- Reference case studies from government IT transformations
- Identify critical success factors for organizational adoption
- Assess whether German government structure is conducive to this type of change
- Consider timing and sequencing of organizational change activities

## Constraints
- Respect German federal system and varying levels of autonomy
- Consider political realities and competing priorities
- Account for diversity of organizational cultures across agencies
- Focus on organizational and political factors, not technical or training issues
- Consider public sector context (different from private sector change management)
