## History
- 2026-01-12: Sub-problem created from implementation-feasibility decomposition
- 2026-01-12: Decomposed into 5 sub-problems: stakeholder-analysis, governance-structures, resistance-management, communication-strategy, organizational-readiness
- 2026-01-12: All 5 sub-problems completed and solutions synthesized into comprehensive change management framework

## Sub-Problems Solved
1. **stakeholder-analysis**: ✓ Completed - Identified 18 stakeholder groups with power/interest mapping
2. **governance-structures**: ✓ Completed - Defined multi-tiered governance leveraging IT Planning Council
3. **resistance-management**: ✓ Completed - Analyzed resistance sources and evidence-based mitigation strategies
4. **communication-strategy**: ✓ Completed - Developed audience-specific communication approaches for 5 groups
5. **organizational-readiness**: ✓ Completed - Assessed moderate-to-good overall readiness with gaps identified

## Solution Summary
Synthesized comprehensive change management framework with five integrated pillars: (1) Stakeholder engagement across federal/state/local levels, (2) Multi-tiered governance coordinated through IT Planning Council, (3) Evidence-based resistance management using ADKAR/Kotter frameworks, (4) Multi-audience communication strategy with works council integration, (5) Organizational readiness assessment showing moderate-to-good preparedness with 2025-2029 window as unique opportunity. Key recommendation: Phased 5-7 year implementation starting with federal agencies and willing states, with 30-40% of budget dedicated to change management equal to technical implementation.
