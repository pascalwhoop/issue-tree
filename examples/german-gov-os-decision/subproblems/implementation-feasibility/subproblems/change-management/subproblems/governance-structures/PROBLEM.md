# Sub-Problem: Governance and Coordination Structures

## Question
What governance structures and coordination mechanisms should be established to manage OS decisions and implementation across Germany's federal, state, and local government entities?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "How should the German government manage organizational change for OS migration or standardization across federal, state, and local government entities?"

Germany's federal system presents unique governance challenges for nationwide IT initiatives:
- **Constitutional autonomy**: States (Länder) have significant autonomy, especially in areas like education and local administration
- **Coordination complexity**: Federal, 16 state, and thousands of local governments with varying IT maturity
- **No direct authority**: Federal government cannot mandate state/local IT decisions
- **Existing coordination bodies**: IT Planning Council (IT-Planungsrat), but with limited enforcement power

Critical governance questions:
- Who makes binding decisions vs. provides recommendations?
- How are conflicts resolved between government levels?
- What role do existing bodies like IT-Planungsrat play?
- How is funding and resource allocation governed?
- What standards/guidelines are mandatory vs. voluntary?
- How is implementation progress monitored and enforced?

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Propose governance structure respecting German federalism and constitutional constraints
- Define decision-making authority and processes at each government level
- Specify coordination mechanisms between federal, state, and local entities
- Address role of existing bodies (IT-Planungsrat, federal IT agencies)
- Propose dispute resolution mechanisms
- Define accountability and enforcement approaches (recognizing limited federal authority)
- Specify governance for technical standards, procurement, and implementation
- Address funding governance and resource allocation
- Consider governance for ongoing operations post-implementation
- Draw on federal IT governance frameworks and best practices
- Reference German government IT coordination precedents (e.g., OZG implementation)
- Consider political feasibility given German federal structure
- Propose communication and reporting structures
- Address timing and evolution of governance as implementation progresses

## Constraints
- Must respect German federal system and state autonomy
- Cannot assume direct federal control over state/local entities
- Must work within existing legal and constitutional framework
- Should leverage existing coordination bodies where possible
- Consider political realities and coalition dynamics
