## History
- 2026-01-12: Sub-problem created from change-management decomposition
- 2026-01-12: Started solving - researching German federal IT governance structures
- 2026-01-12: Completed solution - comprehensive governance framework proposed based on IT Planning Council and FITKO

## Summary

Proposed multi-tiered governance framework leveraging existing German federal IT coordination bodies:
- **Tier 1**: IT Planning Council as strategic decision-making authority
- **Tier 2**: FITKO as operational implementation arm
- **Tier 3**: New OS-specific working groups for technical coordination
- **Tier 4**: Local autonomy within coordinated framework

Solution addresses decision-making processes, coordination mechanisms, dispute resolution, funding governance, accountability, enforcement, standards governance, and phased implementation timeline.

Based on extensive research of German IT governance structures, OZG precedents, international examples (Switzerland, Austria), and government OS migration case studies (Munich LiMux, French Gendarmerie).
