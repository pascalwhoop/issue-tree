# Sub-Problem: Organizational Readiness Assessment

## Question
How organizationally ready is the German government for large-scale OS change, considering cultural factors, change capacity, political environment, structural factors, and historical precedents?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "How should the German government manage organizational change for OS migration or standardization across federal, state, and local government entities?"

Organizational readiness determines whether a major change initiative should proceed, and what preparatory work is needed. Attempting change when an organization is not ready leads to failure, wasted resources, and change fatigue.

Key readiness dimensions:
- **Cultural readiness**: Attitude toward change, innovation, risk-taking
- **Change capacity**: Bandwidth given existing initiatives, change fatigue
- **Leadership alignment**: Support from political and administrative leadership
- **Resource availability**: Budget, staffing, time
- **Structural factors**: Organizational design, decision-making processes
- **Historical context**: Past change experiences, success/failure patterns
- **External environment**: Political stability, economic conditions, public opinion

German government-specific readiness factors:
- Federal structure and state autonomy
- Coalition politics and political cycles
- Public sector culture and incentives
- Existing IT modernization initiatives (OZG, digital sovereignty efforts)
- Recent experiences with major IT projects
- Economic and political stability
- EU context and requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess readiness across multiple dimensions (cultural, capacity, leadership, etc.)
- Evaluate readiness at different government levels (federal, state, local)
- Identify readiness strengths and weaknesses
- Compare German government readiness to readiness factors in successful cases
- Assess whether readiness is sufficient to proceed or needs development
- Identify specific readiness gaps that must be addressed
- Propose strategies for building readiness where gaps exist
- Evaluate timeline for readiness development if gaps are significant
- Consider how readiness varies across different agencies/states
- Address historical precedents of German government IT change
- Assess impact of current initiatives on change capacity
- Evaluate political window and timing considerations
- Draw on organizational readiness research and assessment frameworks
- Reference case studies of government readiness for IT transformation
- Provide overall readiness verdict with confidence level and caveats

## Constraints
- Base assessment on observable factors and precedents, not speculation
- Consider German-specific cultural and structural factors
- Account for diversity across federal, state, and local levels
- Consider current political and economic environment (2026)
- Focus on organizational readiness, not technical readiness
- Be realistic about public sector change capacity and culture
