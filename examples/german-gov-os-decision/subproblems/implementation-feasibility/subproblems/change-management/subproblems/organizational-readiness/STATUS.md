- 2026-01-12: Status updated to solved - comprehensive readiness assessment completed

## Summary

Completed comprehensive organizational readiness assessment for German government OS change.

**Verdict**: MODERATE-TO-GOOD readiness with significant variance across dimensions and government levels. Federal level shows good-to-high readiness (7/10), state level moderate with high variance (5-6/10 average), local level low-to-moderate (3-5/10).

**Key Strengths**:
- Unprecedented political alignment and leadership commitment (2025 coalition)
- Strong financial resources (€34.2B through 2029)
- Institutional infrastructure (ZenDiS, FITKO, IT Planning Council)
- Successful precedents (Schleswig-Holstein)
- Favorable external environment and timing

**Key Gaps**:
- Change capacity overload (multiple parallel initiatives)
- Coordination complexity (federal structure)
- Municipal readiness weakness
- Change management capacity limitations
- Political sustainability risk

**Recommendation**: Proceed with phased implementation starting with federal ministries and willing states, while investing 12-18 months in building readiness at lower levels. Timeline: 5-7 years for comprehensive migration.
