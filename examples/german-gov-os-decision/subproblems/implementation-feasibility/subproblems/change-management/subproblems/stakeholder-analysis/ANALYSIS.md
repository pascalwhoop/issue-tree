# Analysis: Stakeholder Mapping and Concerns

## Understanding of the Problem

The question asks for comprehensive stakeholder mapping across the complex German government structure (federal, state, local) for OS decisions. This requires identifying:
1. Key stakeholder groups at each level
2. Their power/influence and interest levels
3. Specific concerns about OS changes
4. Motivations driving their positions
5. Potential champions and blockers

## Why I Chose to Solve

This problem can be answered directly through targeted research because:
- It's a focused analytical question about stakeholder identification
- The dimensions (concerns, motivations, influence) are aspects of describing stakeholders, not separate questions
- Research methods include: German government structure analysis, IT governance frameworks, case studies
- Stakeholder mapping is a well-established methodology I can apply

## Research Plan

**Sources and Methods:**

1. **German Government Structure**: Research federal system, ministries, IT agencies (BSI, ITZBund)
2. **Case Studies**: Look for German government IT initiatives (Munich LiMux, digital sovereignty initiatives)
3. **Stakeholder Theory**: Apply power/interest matrix and stakeholder analysis frameworks
4. **Public Sector IT Governance**: Research German e-government strategies and IT decision-making
5. **EU Context**: Consider European digital sovereignty initiatives affecting German decisions

**Key Areas to Research:**

- Federal level stakeholders (ministries, agencies, CIO offices)
- State (Länder) level autonomy and IT decision-making
- Municipal associations and local government IT
- Cross-cutting groups (IT professionals, works councils, unions, users)
- External influences (vendors, EU, citizens)
- Political dynamics (coalition governments, federal-state relations)

**Analysis Framework:**

I'll use a stakeholder power/interest matrix combined with detailed profiles for each key group, addressing:
- Formal authority vs. informal influence
- Competing interests and potential conflicts
- Change readiness and resistance factors
- German-specific cultural and political context

## What I'm Looking For

- Names and roles of key German government IT agencies and decision-makers
- Evidence of federal-state coordination mechanisms for IT
- Historical examples of IT change resistance or success
- Specific concerns raised in public documents or case studies
- Organizational culture factors in German public sector
- Political considerations in coalition and federal system
