# Sub-Problem: Stakeholder Mapping and Concerns

## Question
Who are the key stakeholders at federal, state, and local levels in German government regarding OS decisions, and what are their specific concerns, motivations, influence levels, and interests?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "How should the German government manage organizational change for OS migration or standardization across federal, state, and local government entities?"

Effective change management begins with comprehensive stakeholder analysis. The German government's federal structure creates a complex stakeholder landscape with multiple levels of authority, diverse organizational cultures, and varying interests.

Key stakeholder dimensions to examine:
- **Federal level**: Ministries, federal IT agencies (BSI, ITZBund), political leadership
- **State level**: 16 state governments with varying autonomy and IT approaches
- **Local level**: Thousands of municipalities with diverse needs and capabilities
- **Cross-cutting**: IT staff, end users, works councils, vendor partners, citizens

Each stakeholder group has different:
- **Power/influence** over OS decisions
- **Interest** in the outcome
- **Concerns** about change (budget, control, usability, security, etc.)
- **Motivations** (political, operational, professional, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify key stakeholder groups at all government levels
- Map stakeholders by power/influence and interest level
- Describe specific concerns for each stakeholder group
- Assess motivations (what drives their positions)
- Evaluate influence on OS decisions and implementation
- Identify potential champions and blockers
- Consider unique aspects of German government structure (federalism, coalition politics, etc.)
- Address both formal authority and informal influence
- Consider external stakeholders (vendors, citizens, EU)
- Reference stakeholder theory and government change management frameworks
- Draw on case studies of German government IT initiatives where available

## Constraints
- Focus on organizational stakeholders (people/groups), not technical factors
- Consider German-specific political and cultural context
- Respect federal structure with varying state autonomy
- Account for public sector dynamics (political cycles, public accountability, etc.)
