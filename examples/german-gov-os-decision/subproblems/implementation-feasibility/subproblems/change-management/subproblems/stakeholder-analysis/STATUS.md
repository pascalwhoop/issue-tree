## Summary

Completed comprehensive stakeholder mapping across federal, state, and local levels of German government for OS decisions. Identified 18 key stakeholder groups, mapped them by power/influence and interest levels, analyzed their specific concerns and motivations, and identified potential champions and blockers. Analysis draws on multiple case studies (Munich LiMux, Schleswig-Holstein Linux migration, Foreign Ministry), official government sources (IT Planning Council, BSI), and stakeholder management frameworks.
