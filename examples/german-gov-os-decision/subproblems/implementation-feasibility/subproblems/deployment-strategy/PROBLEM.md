# Sub-Problem: Deployment Strategy and Timeline

## Question
What is the optimal deployment strategy for rolling out an OS choice across the German government, and what realistic timeline should be expected?

## Context
This sub-problem examines the actual execution roadmap for implementation. Even with technical feasibility, organizational readiness, and trained staff, poor deployment strategy can lead to chaos, failures, and wasted resources.

The parent problem asks: "What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?"

Deployment strategy is critical because:
- Sequencing and phasing affect risk, cost, and disruption
- Coordination across hundreds of entities requires clear planning
- Different deployment approaches have different success rates
- Timeline expectations must be realistic based on evidence
- Pilot programs can validate approach before full rollout
- Parallel operation periods affect costs and complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Evaluate deployment approach options (big-bang, phased, pilot-first, hybrid)
- Propose specific phasing strategy (by agency, by function, by geography, by readiness)
- Assess pilot program approaches and success criteria
- Provide realistic timeline estimates based on case studies and scale
- Address coordination mechanisms across federal, state, and local entities
- Consider parallel operation periods (running both systems simultaneously)
- Define deployment milestones and success metrics
- Evaluate rollout velocity trade-offs (speed vs risk vs cost)
- Consider seasonal and operational constraints (avoid disruption during critical periods)
- Address deployment infrastructure needs (imaging, automation, support)
- Propose go/no-go decision points and criteria
- Draw on case studies from government OS deployments
- Compare deployment strategies for Windows vs Linux migrations
- Assess critical path activities and dependencies
- Identify factors that could accelerate or delay timeline

## Constraints
- Consider German federal system and entity autonomy
- Account for heterogeneous starting conditions across agencies
- Focus on deployment execution, not technical details or training content
- Assume technical feasibility and organizational readiness established separately
- Consider realistic timelines (years, not months for government-wide change)
- Account for political and budget cycles
