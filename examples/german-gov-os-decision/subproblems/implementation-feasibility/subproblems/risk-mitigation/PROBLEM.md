# Sub-Problem: Risk Mitigation and Contingency Planning

## Question
What are the critical risks for OS migration or standardization in German government, and what mitigation strategies and contingency plans should be in place?

## Context
This sub-problem examines risk management for implementation. Large-scale government IT projects have high failure rates, and understanding what can go wrong and how to prepare is essential for successful implementation.

The parent problem asks: "What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?"

Risk mitigation is critical because:
- Government IT projects have high visibility and political consequences
- Failures can disrupt critical government services
- Costs and timelines often exceed initial estimates
- Vendor dependencies can create lock-in or support failures
- Technical problems can cascade across integrated systems
- User resistance can undermine even well-planned implementations

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify critical failure scenarios and their likelihood
- Assess impact of different risk categories (technical, organizational, vendor, political)
- Evaluate rollback capabilities and requirements
- Propose contingency plans for major risk scenarios
- Address business continuity during transition periods
- Consider vendor lock-in risks and exit strategy options
- Propose testing and quality assurance approaches
- Define incident response and escalation procedures
- Establish success criteria and go/no-go decision points
- Assess financial risk (cost overruns, budget constraints)
- Consider political risk (leadership changes, policy shifts)
- Evaluate support continuity risk (vendor failure, skills shortage)
- Draw on lessons from government IT project failures
- Compare risk profiles for different OS choices (Windows vs Linux)
- Propose risk monitoring and early warning indicators
- Identify which risks are acceptable vs unacceptable

## Constraints
- Consider German government context and risk tolerance
- Account for public sector accountability requirements
- Focus on risks specific to OS implementation, not general IT project risks
- Consider multi-level government structure and coordination risks
- Address both transition risks and long-term operational risks
- Consider precedent from Munich's LiMux project and similar cases
