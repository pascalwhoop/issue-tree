# Sub-Problem: Technical Migration Challenges

## Question
What are the specific technical obstacles and requirements for migrating to or deploying an OS at scale in the German government infrastructure?

## Context
This sub-problem examines the technical dimension of implementation feasibility. Even with organizational readiness and good training, technical barriers can make implementation infeasible or drastically increase complexity and cost.

The parent problem asks: "What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?"

Technical migration challenges are a critical component of feasibility assessment because they:
- Determine whether migration is technically possible
- Influence timeline and cost estimates
- Identify infrastructure investments needed
- Reveal compatibility risks that could cause deployment failures

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify key technical obstacles for OS migration/deployment at government scale
- Assess system compatibility and integration challenges
- Evaluate application compatibility requirements (custom and commercial software)
- Consider hardware compatibility and lifecycle implications
- Address data migration and preservation requirements
- Examine legacy system handling strategies
- Assess infrastructure requirements (servers, deployment tools, testing environments)
- Consider network and security infrastructure implications
- Evaluate interoperability with existing IT ecosystem
- Draw on real-world examples from government OS migrations
- Distinguish between Windows-to-Linux, Linux-to-Windows, and standardization scenarios
- Assess technical difficulty and complexity level
- Identify which challenges are solvable vs showstoppers

## Constraints
- Consider the heterogeneous current environment in German government
- Focus on actual technical barriers, not organizational or training issues
- Consider both desktop and server deployments
- Account for multi-level government structure (federal, state, local may have different systems)
- Consider both modern and legacy systems
