# Analysis: Application Compatibility Challenges

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks about the application compatibility challenges and requirements for OS migration in the German government, considering both custom-developed and commercial software.

Application compatibility is often cited as the primary technical barrier to OS migration. Government agencies depend on diverse software portfolios including:
- Productivity suites (office applications)
- Custom-developed applications specific to government functions
- Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software
- Web-based applications
- Legacy applications
- Specialized government software (document management, case management, etc.)

## Why I Chose to Solve Directly

This is a well-defined question that can be answered through research and analysis of:
1. Real-world government OS migration case studies
2. Current state of cross-platform software availability
3. Compatibility layer technologies and their maturity
4. Government-specific software categories and their portability
5. Document format compatibility issues

The question is focused enough that decomposition would add unnecessary complexity. I can research and synthesize findings directly.

## Research Plan

I will investigate:

1. **Application categories in government environments**: What types of applications do government agencies use?

2. **Compatibility challenges by category**:
   - Desktop productivity (Office suites)
   - Web-based applications
   - Custom applications
   - Commercial specialized software
   - Legacy applications

3. **Compatibility solutions**:
   - Native cross-platform software
   - Compatibility layers (Wine, WSL)
   - Web-based alternatives
   - Virtualization

4. **Real-world experiences**: Draw on actual government migration case studies, particularly:
   - Munich's LiMux project (Windows to Linux)
   - French Gendarmerie migration
   - Italian military migration
   - Other European government experiences
   - Any reverse migrations (Linux to Windows)

5. **Specific showstoppers**: Applications with no viable migration path

6. **Effort assessment**: Application inventory, testing, and validation requirements

## Information Sources

- Web search for government OS migration case studies
- Research on compatibility layer maturity
- Government IT reports and evaluations
- Software vendor cross-platform support status
- Technical assessments of office suite compatibility
