# Analysis: Data Migration and Legacy System Integration

## Problem Understanding

This problem asks about the data migration challenges and legacy system integration requirements when migrating operating systems in German government infrastructure. This is critical because:

1. **Data Integrity**: Government data must be preserved with complete integrity and legal compliance
2. **Operational Continuity**: Systems must continue functioning during and after migration
3. **Legal Requirements**: German data protection and archival laws impose strict requirements
4. **Scale and Complexity**: Decades of accumulated data across heterogeneous systems
5. **Legacy Systems**: Some systems may be too costly or risky to migrate but must continue operating

## Why I Chose to SOLVE

I'm choosing to solve this directly through research because:

1. This is a well-documented area in government IT migrations
2. Real-world examples exist from German and European government migrations
3. The specific technical challenges are established in IT migration literature
4. The question requires synthesis of known migration issues, not breaking down into sub-questions
5. I can comprehensively address all acceptance criteria through targeted research

## Research Plan

I will investigate:

1. **Government Migration Case Studies**
   - Munich's LiMux project data migration experiences
   - Other German/European government migrations
   - Lessons learned and documented challenges

2. **Data Types and Migration Requirements**
   - Document formats (Office documents, PDFs, archives)
   - Database systems (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL)
   - Email and collaboration systems (Exchange, groupware)
   - File shares (SMB/CIFS, NFS)
   - User profiles and settings

3. **File Format Compatibility**
   - Microsoft Office vs LibreOffice/OpenOffice compatibility
   - PDF standards and preservation
   - Specialized government formats (CAD, GIS, etc.)

4. **Legacy System Strategies**
   - Virtualization approaches
   - Dual-boot or parallel systems
   - Terminal server/Citrix solutions
   - Application compatibility layers (Wine, etc.)
   - When to replace vs preserve

5. **Migration Tools and Automation**
   - Available data migration tools
   - Automated testing and verification
   - Batch migration vs phased approaches

6. **Regulatory and Preservation Requirements**
   - German archival law requirements
   - Data protection regulations
   - Chain of custody requirements
   - Long-term digital preservation standards

## Sources I'll Use

- Government migration reports and case studies
- Technical documentation on cross-platform data migration
- German government IT standards and regulations
- Industry best practices for large-scale migrations
- Academic research on digital preservation

## Success Criteria

My solution will comprehensively address:
- Types of data requiring migration
- File format compatibility challenges
- Database migration approaches
- Email and collaboration data
- User profile/settings migration
- Legacy system handling strategies
- Archive and preservation requirements
- Metadata and permissions preservation
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Real-world experiences and lessons learned
