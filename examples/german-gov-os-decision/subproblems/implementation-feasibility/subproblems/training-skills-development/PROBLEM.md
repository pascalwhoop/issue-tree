# Sub-Problem: Training and Skills Development

## Question
What training infrastructure, programs, and skills development initiatives are required for successful OS adoption across the German government, and are these requirements achievable at scale?

## Context
This sub-problem examines the human capital dimension of implementation. Even with perfect technology and organizational buy-in, implementations fail if users and IT staff lack necessary skills and knowledge.

The parent problem asks: "What are the practical implementation challenges and requirements for OS migration or standardization in the German government, and what implementation strategy would be most effective?"

Training and skills development are critical because:
- Tens to hundreds of thousands of government employees need training
- IT staff require deep technical skills for system administration and support
- End users need basic operational competency
- Different roles require different training levels and approaches
- Inadequate training leads to low productivity, resistance, and support burden
- Skills gaps can make systems unsupportable in the long term

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess training needs for different audiences (IT staff, end users, management)
- Evaluate required technical skills for IT staff (system administration, troubleshooting, deployment)
- Assess end user training requirements (basic operations, productivity applications)
- Propose training delivery methods (online, in-person, hybrid, train-the-trainer)
- Estimate training timeline and sequencing relative to deployment
- Evaluate ongoing support and knowledge management requirements
- Assess current skills gap (what skills exist vs what's needed)
- Consider certification and competency requirements
- Estimate training costs and resource requirements
- Evaluate availability of trainers and training materials (especially for German language)
- Address learning curve differences between Windows and Linux
- Consider help desk and support infrastructure needs
- Draw on case studies of government OS training programs
- Assess whether scale of training is feasible within reasonable timeline
- Identify critical success factors for training effectiveness

## Constraints
- Consider scale: potentially 100K+ government employees
- Account for varying technical literacy levels
- Consider multi-level government structure and coordination needs
- Focus on training and skills, not organizational change or technical issues
- Consider German language requirements for materials and support
- Account for ongoing training needs (new hires, system updates)
