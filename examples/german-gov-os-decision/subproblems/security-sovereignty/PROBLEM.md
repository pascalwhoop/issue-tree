# Sub-Problem: Security and Data Sovereignty Analysis

## Question
How do Linux and Windows compare on security posture and data sovereignty requirements for German government use?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the security and sovereignty dimension of the parent problem: "Should the German government use Linux or Windows?"

Government IT infrastructure has unique security requirements due to handling sensitive citizen data, classified information, and critical infrastructure. Additionally, the German government has stated goals around digital sovereignty - the ability to control and audit the software running on government systems without dependence on foreign entities.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is evaluating whether the German government should adopt Linux or Windows as its core operating system for government infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Compare vulnerability track records and patch response times for both OS
- Assess data sovereignty implications (open source vs proprietary, data collection, telemetry)
- Evaluate government's ability to audit and verify security of each OS
- Consider supply chain security and backdoor risks
- Analyze compliance with German and EU regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- Review security certification status (Common Criteria, etc.)
- Assess cryptographic capabilities and secure boot support
- Consider incident response and forensics capabilities
- Provide evidence from security research and government assessments
- Address concerns about foreign government influence or surveillance

## Constraints
- Focus on German government context and requirements
- Consider both technical security and sovereignty/policy aspects
- Address both current security posture and ability to respond to future threats
- Assume modern, fully-patched versions of both OS
