# Sub-Problem: Technical Compatibility and Requirements

## Question
What are the technical compatibility requirements and constraints for German government IT systems, and how do Linux and Windows meet these requirements?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the technical feasibility dimension of the parent problem: "Should the German government use Linux or Windows?"

Government agencies have existing IT infrastructure, specialized software applications, hardware requirements, and interoperability needs. Any OS choice must work with this existing ecosystem or provide viable alternatives. Technical compatibility issues can be showstoppers regardless of other advantages.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is evaluating whether the German government should adopt Linux or Windows as its core operating system for government infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify critical software applications used in German government
- Assess availability of these applications (or viable alternatives) on each OS
- Evaluate document format compatibility and interoperability
- Consider hardware compatibility and driver support
- Assess integration with existing enterprise systems (Active Directory, etc.)
- Evaluate printing, scanning, and peripheral device support
- Consider specialized government applications and systems
- Address web application compatibility
- Assess email and collaboration tool compatibility
- Evaluate virtualization and cloud integration capabilities
- Consider multi-OS environment management if hybrid approach is needed
- Provide evidence from technical assessments and pilots

## Constraints
- Focus on German government context and actual requirements
- Consider both common office work and specialized government functions
- Address both current compatibility and future flexibility
- Assume proper implementation and configuration of chosen OS
