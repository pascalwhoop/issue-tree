# Sub-Problem: Application and Software Compatibility

## Question
What are the critical desktop and productivity applications used in German government operations, and how do Linux and Windows compare in terms of application availability, alternatives, and compatibility?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses application-level compatibility for the technical compatibility assessment. Government employees need access to reliable, functional software for daily operations. The availability of critical applications—or viable alternatives—on each operating system is a fundamental technical requirement.

This contributes to answering whether Linux can provide the same application-level functionality as Windows for German government users, or whether application gaps would create significant barriers to adoption.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is assessing technical compatibility requirements and constraints for German government IT systems, comparing Linux and Windows.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Identify core productivity applications needed (office suites, email clients, PDF tools, web browsers)
- Assess native availability on both Linux and Windows
- Evaluate open source alternatives (LibreOffice vs Microsoft Office, etc.)
- Consider application virtualization options (Wine, CrossOver, containers)
- Assess software update and patch management mechanisms
- Evaluate licensing and deployment models for each platform
- Consider user training requirements for alternative applications
- Review evidence from German government pilots or migrations (LiMux, etc.)
- Assess compatibility of file formats between applications
- Consider both desktop and web-based applications
- Address accessibility and internationalization support
- Provide evidence from technical documentation and real-world deployments
