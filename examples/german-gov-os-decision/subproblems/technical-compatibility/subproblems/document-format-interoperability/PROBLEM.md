# Sub-Problem: Document Format and Interoperability

## Question
How do Linux and Windows compare in their ability to handle document formats, ensure interoperability with external partners, and meet German government document standards and requirements?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses document format compatibility and data exchange for the technical compatibility assessment. Government agencies must exchange documents internally, with other government bodies, with EU partners, with businesses, and with citizens.

Document format compatibility issues can cause workflow disruptions, data loss, formatting problems, and legal compliance issues. The German government also has specific requirements for long-term archival, digital signatures, and document standards.

This contributes to determining whether Linux-based office applications can reliably exchange documents with Windows-based systems without compatibility issues that would impact operations or compliance.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is assessing technical compatibility requirements and constraints for German government IT systems, comparing Linux and Windows.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess Microsoft Office format compatibility (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX) between platforms
- Evaluate LibreOffice/OpenOffice fidelity with MS Office formats
- Assess ODF (Open Document Format) support and German government policies
- Evaluate PDF handling, creation, and digital signature capabilities
- Assess email and calendar format interoperability (PST, ICS, vCard)
- Examine compatibility with EU and international document exchange standards
- Evaluate long-term document archival standards (PDF/A compliance)
- Assess German government-specific document requirements (e.g., ZUGFeRD for e-invoicing)
- Consider document management system integration
- Evaluate support for accessibility standards (PDF/UA, etc.)
- Assess metadata and document property preservation
- Examine macro and scripting compatibility (VBA, etc.)
- Consider complex document features (tables, charts, embedded objects)
- Review evidence from government migrations and compatibility testing
- Address both current compatibility and future-proofing concerns
