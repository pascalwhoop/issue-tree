## History
- 2026-01-12: Sub-problem created from technical-compatibility decomposition
- 2026-01-12: Decomposed into 5 sub-problems covering different enterprise integration domains
- 2026-01-12: All 5 sub-problems solved; synthesized comprehensive solution

## Sub-problems Completed
1. directory-services-authentication - Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, SSO, Group Policy (solved)
2. email-collaboration-systems - Exchange, SharePoint, collaboration platforms (solved)
3. identity-access-management - SAML, OAuth, MFA, PKI, certificates (solved)
4. systems-management-monitoring - Endpoint management, patch management, SIEM (solved)
5. infrastructure-services - Backup, file sharing, printing, VPN, network services (solved)

## Synthesis Notes
Synthesized solutions from all 5 subproblems into comprehensive enterprise systems integration assessment. Key findings: Linux can successfully integrate with German government enterprise systems at 30,000+ user scale (validated by Schleswig-Holstein deployment). Success requires strategic choice between Microsoft dependency vs open-source migration, comprehensive training, and realistic multi-year planning.
