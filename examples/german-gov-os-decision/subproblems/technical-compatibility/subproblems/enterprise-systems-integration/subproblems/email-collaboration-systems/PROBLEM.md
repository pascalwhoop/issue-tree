# Sub-Problem: Email and Collaboration Systems

## Question
How do Linux and Windows compare in their integration with email systems and collaboration platforms, particularly Microsoft Exchange, alternatives, and collaborative document/project management tools?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses email and collaboration system integration, which is essential for daily government operations. Email, calendaring, contacts, and document collaboration are mission-critical services that must work seamlessly across the organization.

Government agencies often use Microsoft Exchange for email, along with collaboration platforms like SharePoint, Teams, or alternatives. The OS choice must support:
- Email client functionality (desktop and web)
- Calendar and meeting scheduling
- Shared contacts and distribution lists
- Presence and instant messaging
- Document collaboration and version control
- Integration with mobile devices

Understanding whether Linux can provide equivalent functionality or requires alternative solutions is critical for assessing practical usability in government operations.

This contributes to determining whether Linux can match Windows in supporting daily communication and collaboration workflows.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is assessing how Linux and Windows compare in enterprise systems integration for German government IT infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess Microsoft Exchange integration from Linux (email, calendar, contacts)
- Evaluate available email clients (Evolution, Thunderbird, web clients)
- Examine calendar and scheduling functionality
- Assess collaboration platform alternatives to SharePoint (NextCloud, ownCloud, etc.)
- Evaluate Teams/Skype integration or alternatives
- Consider web-based access as an integration path
- Assess mobile device synchronization
- Evaluate document collaboration and version control tools
- Review standards-based protocols (IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, ActiveSync)
- Consider user experience and feature parity
- Identify gaps, limitations, or workarounds
- Provide evidence from real-world government deployments
