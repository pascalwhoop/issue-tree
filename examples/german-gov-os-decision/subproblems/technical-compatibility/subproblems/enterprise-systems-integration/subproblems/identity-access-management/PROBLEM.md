# Sub-Problem: Identity and Access Management

## Question
How do Linux and Windows compare in their integration with modern identity and access management (IAM) systems, including SAML, OAuth, multi-factor authentication, certificate management, and PKI infrastructure?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses modern identity and access management beyond basic directory services. Government environments increasingly require:
- Federated authentication and single sign-on (SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and strong authentication
- Smart card and certificate-based authentication
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) integration
- Privileged access management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Integration with cloud identity providers

These modern IAM capabilities are essential for meeting security requirements, enabling secure remote access, and integrating with cloud services while maintaining strong authentication and authorization controls.

Understanding how well Linux supports modern IAM standards and tools compared to Windows is critical for assessing long-term technical compatibility.

This contributes to determining whether Linux can meet modern security and identity requirements in German government environments.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is assessing how Linux and Windows compare in enterprise systems integration for German government IT infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess SAML/OAuth/OpenID Connect support and integration
- Evaluate multi-factor authentication capabilities
- Examine smart card and certificate-based authentication
- Assess PKI integration and certificate management
- Evaluate privileged access management tools
- Consider integration with modern IAM solutions (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)
- Assess credential management and password policies
- Evaluate support for hardware security tokens (YubiKey, etc.)
- Examine biometric authentication support
- Consider compliance with German/EU authentication standards
- Review available tools and their maturity
- Identify gaps, limitations, or differences in capabilities
- Provide evidence from security assessments and deployments
