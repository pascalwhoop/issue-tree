# Sub-Problem: Hardware and Peripheral Support

## Question
How do Linux and Windows compare in terms of hardware compatibility, driver availability, and support for peripherals commonly used in German government operations?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses hardware-level compatibility for the technical compatibility assessment. Government agencies use diverse hardware including desktop computers, laptops, printers, scanners, multifunction devices, smart card readers, security tokens, biometric devices, and specialized peripherals.

Poor hardware or driver support can lead to non-functional equipment, productivity losses, security vulnerabilities, and increased support costs. Hardware compatibility is often cited as a concern for Linux adoption in enterprise environments.

This contributes to determining whether Linux can reliably support the full range of hardware used in German government operations, or whether hardware limitations would create operational barriers.

## Parent Problem
The parent problem is assessing technical compatibility requirements and constraints for German government IT systems, comparing Linux and Windows.

## Acceptance Criteria
A good answer should:
- Assess modern desktop and laptop hardware compatibility (CPUs, GPUs, WiFi, Bluetooth)
- Evaluate printer and scanner driver availability and functionality
- Assess multifunction device (MFD) support including network printers
- Evaluate smart card reader support (for government ID cards, authentication)
- Assess security token support (YubiKey, etc.)
- Examine biometric device support (fingerprint readers, facial recognition)
- Evaluate external storage device support (USB drives, external drives)
- Assess display and monitor compatibility (multiple monitors, high DPI)
- Examine audio and video device support (webcams, headsets, conferencing equipment)
- Evaluate touchscreen and tablet device support
- Consider specialized government hardware (badge readers, document scanners, etc.)
- Assess driver update mechanisms and long-term support
- Examine vendor support for government procurement hardware
- Review evidence from hardware compatibility testing and government pilots
- Consider both current hardware and future procurement flexibility
- Address driver signing and security considerations
