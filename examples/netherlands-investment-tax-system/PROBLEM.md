# Problem: Netherlands Investment Taxation System

## Question
Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or should it maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?

## Context
The Netherlands currently uses a unique system where investment returns are taxed based on a deemed return (Box 3 taxation), effectively taxing unrealized gains. This is different from most countries which tax only realized gains (when assets are actually sold).

**Current System (Unrealized Gains)**:
- Box 3: Wealth tax on deemed returns
- Taxes are applied annually regardless of whether assets are sold
- Based on assumed returns rather than actual gains

**Alternative System (Realized Gains)**:
- Tax only applied when investments are sold
- Based on actual profit/loss from transactions
- More common internationally

This decision has significant implications for:
- Tax revenue stability and predictability
- Investment behavior and capital mobility
- Administrative complexity
- Fairness and equity considerations
- Competitiveness with other jurisdictions

## Success Criteria
A comprehensive analysis that:
- Evaluates economic impacts of both systems
- Considers administrative feasibility
- Analyzes effects on different taxpayer groups
- Compares with international practices
- Provides clear reasoning for recommendation
- Addresses implementation challenges

## Notes
- Recent Dutch court rulings have challenged aspects of the current system
- Political debate is ongoing in the Netherlands
- Consider both short-term and long-term consequences
- Account for behavioral responses to taxation changes
