# Sub-Problem: Administrative Feasibility Assessment

## Question
What are the administrative costs, implementation complexity, compliance burden, and enforcement implications of realized gains taxation versus unrealized gains taxation?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?"

Understanding the practical feasibility of implementing and administering each system is essential for policy evaluation, as administrative costs and compliance burdens can significantly impact net benefits.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive assessment that covers:
- **Tax authority costs**: Systems, personnel, auditing requirements for each approach
- **Taxpayer compliance burden**: Record-keeping, reporting complexity, time costs
- **Implementation costs**: One-time transition costs if switching systems
- **Enforcement challenges**: Tax avoidance opportunities, audit complexity
- **Technology requirements**: IT systems needed for tracking and administration
- **International examples**: How other countries handle administrative aspects

## Key Considerations
- Realized gains require tracking cost basis, acquisition dates, transactions
- Unrealized gains require annual valuations of assets
- Different asset types have different administrative challenges
- Integration with existing tax infrastructure
- Capacity of tax authority and taxpayers to handle complexity
