# Analysis: Economic Impact of Realized vs Unrealized Gains Taxation

## Understanding the Problem

This node examines the economic effects of two different capital gains taxation approaches:

1. **Realized Gains Taxation**: Tax applied only when assets are sold (actual transactions)
2. **Unrealized Gains Taxation**: Tax applied on deemed returns or paper gains (Netherlands Box 3 system)

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a well-defined economic policy question that can be addressed through:
- Academic research on capital gains taxation
- Economic theory on behavioral responses
- Empirical evidence from different tax systems
- Analysis of the Netherlands-specific context

While multifaceted, it doesn't require decomposition because all aspects relate to the same core economic mechanism.

## Research Plan

I will investigate:

1. **Revenue Effects**
   - Timing and volatility of tax collections
   - Revenue predictability and budgeting implications
   - Lock-in effects on realization behavior
   - Evidence from countries with different systems

2. **Investment Behavior**
   - Lock-in effect under realized gains (deferral incentive)
   - Portfolio rebalancing and trading activity
   - Risk-taking and entrepreneurship
   - Tax avoidance strategies

3. **Market Efficiency**
   - Capital allocation effects
   - Asset pricing distortions
   - Liquidity impacts
   - Economic deadweight loss

4. **Capital Mobility**
   - International competitiveness
   - Capital flight risks
   - Tax competition effects

5. **Economic Literature**
   - Theoretical frameworks
   - Empirical studies
   - Cross-country comparisons
