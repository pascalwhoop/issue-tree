# Sub-Problem: Economic Impact Analysis

## Question
What are the economic effects of realized gains taxation versus unrealized gains taxation on government revenue, investment behavior, market efficiency, and capital mobility?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?"

The Netherlands currently taxes unrealized gains through Box 3 deemed returns. Understanding the economic implications of switching to realized gains taxation is critical for making an informed policy recommendation.

## Acceptance Criteria
A thorough analysis that addresses:
- **Revenue effects**: Stability, predictability, and total tax revenue under each system
- **Investment behavior**: Lock-in effects, portfolio decisions, trading activity
- **Market efficiency**: Impact on capital allocation and asset pricing
- **Capital mobility**: Effects on capital flight and international investment flows
- **Economic literature**: What does research say about these effects?
- **Quantitative estimates**: Where possible, provide numerical estimates or ranges

## Key Considerations
- Timing differences in revenue realization
- Behavioral responses (lock-in effect under realized gains)
- Volatility of revenue streams
- Impact on different asset classes
- Effects on entrepreneurship and innovation
