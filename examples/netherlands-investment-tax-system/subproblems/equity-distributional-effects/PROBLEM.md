# Sub-Problem: Equity and Distributional Effects

## Question
How does each taxation system (realized vs unrealized gains) affect fairness and equity across different taxpayer groups, including different wealth levels, income levels, and asset types?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?"

Equity and fairness considerations are central to tax policy. Different systems may advantage or disadvantage different groups, raising questions of horizontal equity (equal treatment of equals) and vertical equity (progressive treatment based on ability to pay).

## Acceptance Criteria
A thorough equity analysis covering:
- **Vertical equity**: How each system affects different wealth/income levels
- **Horizontal equity**: Whether similar taxpayers are treated similarly
- **Asset type effects**: How liquid vs illiquid assets are treated
- **Life cycle effects**: Impact on young vs old, accumulators vs retirees
- **Liquidity constraints**: Whether taxpayers can afford to pay taxes
- **Tax deferral advantages**: Who benefits from timing differences
- **Realization flexibility**: Strategic timing opportunities and who can exploit them

## Key Considerations
- Unrealized gains tax everyone annually regardless of realization
- Realized gains allow timing control (beneficial for sophisticated investors)
- Lock-in effect may trap less wealthy in suboptimal portfolios
- Illiquid assets (business, real estate) create liquidity issues
- Different asset types have different realization patterns
- Ability to realize gains strategically (tax planning opportunities)
