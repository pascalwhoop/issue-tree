# Analysis: International Comparison and Competitiveness

## Problem Understanding

The question asks for a comprehensive international comparison of investment taxation systems, focusing on:
1. How prevalent are realized vs unrealized gains systems globally?
2. What specific examples exist of each approach?
3. What lessons have other countries learned?
4. How do different systems affect competitiveness and capital flows?
5. What are the EU-specific considerations?

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

While this problem has multiple dimensions, it represents a unified comparative analysis that can be researched and synthesized directly. The aspects are interconnected rather than independent sub-questions. Decomposing would create artificial divisions that would complicate the synthesis of a coherent international comparison.

## Research Plan

1. **Survey international practices**: Identify which countries use realized vs unrealized gains taxation
2. **Detailed country examples**: Research specific implementations in major economies
3. **Netherlands' Box 3 system uniqueness**: Understand what makes it different
4. **Competitiveness studies**: Look for research on tax competition and capital mobility
5. **EU context**: Examine European coordination and competition dynamics
6. **Recent reforms**: Identify trends and lessons from countries that have changed systems
7. **Migration patterns**: Research whether taxation drives high-net-worth individual migration
