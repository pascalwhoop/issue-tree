# Sub-Problem: International Comparison and Competitiveness

## Question
What investment taxation systems do other countries use, what lessons can be learned from international experience, and how does each option affect the Netherlands' tax competitiveness and ability to attract/retain capital?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?"

Understanding international practices provides context for the Netherlands' choice and reveals potential competitive advantages or disadvantages of each system.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive international analysis covering:
- **Prevalence**: How many countries use realized vs unrealized gains systems?
- **Country examples**: Detailed examples of both approaches in practice
- **Lessons learned**: What have other countries experienced?
- **Hybrid approaches**: Are there intermediate or mixed systems?
- **Competitiveness effects**: How do different systems affect capital flows?
- **Tax competition**: Race to the bottom concerns or opportunities
- **EU context**: Specific considerations within European Union
- **Migration patterns**: Do taxation systems drive wealthy migration?

## Key Considerations
- Most countries use realized gains taxation
- Netherlands' Box 3 system is relatively unique
- EU coordination and competition dynamics
- High-net-worth individual mobility
- Impact on attracting foreign investment
- Comparison with Belgium, Germany, France, UK
- Recent trends and reforms in other countries
