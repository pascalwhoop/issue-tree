# Solution: International Comparison and Competitiveness

## Answer

**The Netherlands' Box 3 system of taxing unrealized gains is internationally unique and highly uncommon.** The vast majority of countries use realized gains taxation. Only a handful of countries tax unrealized gains in any form, and none have adopted a capital growth tax system like what the Netherlands is proposing for 2028.

**Key Finding:** Among OECD countries, 33 implement capital gains taxes, and virtually all tax only realized gains. The Netherlands' current Box 3 system (deemed returns on wealth) and proposed 2028 system (capital growth tax on unrealized gains for most assets) represent significant international outliers.

**Competitiveness Impact:** The evidence strongly suggests that the Netherlands' unique approach creates competitive disadvantages:
- Risk of high-net-worth individual migration (as seen in UK, Norway)
- Potential capital flight to more favorable jurisdictions
- Administrative complexity that is internationally uncommon
- Higher effective tax rates on investment returns compared to most peers

## Evidence

### 1. Prevalence: Realized vs Unrealized Gains Systems

**Realized Gains (Standard International Practice):**
- 33 out of 38 OECD countries implement capital gains taxes
- Most OECD countries tax capital gains upon realization, usually at lower rates or with exemptions
- Additional relief often provided for specific assets (housing, closely-held businesses)
- 25 OECD countries fully exclude foreign-sourced capital gains from domestic taxation

**Unrealized Gains (Extremely Rare):**
Only a handful of countries tax unrealized gains in any form:
- **Norway**: Taxes unrealized gains through wealth tax on market value of assets (1% on wealth over NOK 1.7M, additional 1.1% over NOK 20M)
- **Denmark**: Has provisions involving taxation of unrealized gains, particularly for corporate tax
- **Sweden**: Requires annual declaration of market value of certain assets for wealth tax purposes
- **New Zealand**: Taxes gains on financial arrangements on accrual basis (subject to thresholds)
- **Netherlands**: Box 3 system taxes deemed returns on wealth (currently) and will tax unrealized capital growth (from 2028)

**Critical Finding:** A recent survey by the Dutch Association of Tax Advisors found that **none of the 12 surveyed countries has a capital growth tax** like what the Netherlands is proposing for 2028, confirming that this approach is internationally unprecedented.

### 2. Country Examples in Detail

#### Belgium
- **No capital gains tax** on long-held shares for private investors
- "Normal management of private wealth" incurs zero capital gains tax
- Rewards patient, long-term investing
- Professional investors taxed differently based on holding periods and income percentage
- Starting 2026: Ending tax exclusion for capital gains not considered professional income, applying 10% rate

#### Germany
- **Time-based exemptions**: 1 year for crypto/commodities
- **Real estate**: No CGT on primary residences sold after 2 years; exemption after 10 years for investment properties
- Focus on holding period incentives rather than wealth accumulation

#### France
- **30% flat rate** on capital gains (PFU - "flat tax")
- Additional 4% surcharge for high-income earners (34% total)
- One of Europe's higher capital gains tax rates
- Recently introduced 20% minimum tax rate for high-income individuals (income >€250k single, >€500k couples) for 2025
- 8% tax on share buybacks for companies with revenue >€1B (2025)

#### United Kingdom
- Recently **increased top rate from 20% to 24%** (effective 2025)
- This increase has triggered significant capital flight
- Over 16,500 millionaires projected to leave UK in 2025 ($91.8B in assets)
- Nearly quadrupled from 4,200 departures in 2023

#### Switzerland
- **Cantonal wealth taxes** (0.13% to 0.94% depending on location)
- Covers worldwide assets except foreign real estate
- **Highest wealth tax revenue** as share of total tax (3.6% of tax revenue, €9.5B in 2023)
- No federal capital gains tax for private investors
- Most successful wealth tax implementation globally

#### Norway
- **Long history** of wealth taxation (since 1892)
- Generated €2.7B in 2023 (1.5% of tax revenues)
- 2022 wealth tax increase triggered exodus of high-net-worth individuals
- However, research shows only 0.01% of richest households actually relocated

#### Spain
- **Progressive wealth tax**: 0.16% to 3.5% on wealth >€700k
- "Solidarity wealth tax" (2022, made permanent 2023): 1.7% to 3.5% on net assets >€3M
- Generated €3.1B in 2023 (0.6% of total tax revenue)
- Regional variation in rates

#### Italy
- Increasing crypto capital gains tax from 26% to 33% (effective January 2026)
- Eliminated €2,000 exemption threshold for crypto gains
- Focus on emerging asset classes

### 3. Wealth Tax Lessons Learned

**Switzerland (Most Successful Model):**
- Generates significant revenue (4.3% of overall tax revenues)
- Cantonal implementation allows regional competition
- Long-standing system with taxpayer acceptance
- Carefully articulated exemption criteria

**Norway & Spain (Mixed Results):**
- Generate revenue but at <2% of total tax revenues
- High marginal effective tax rates (Spain: above 100% in some cases)
- Norway experienced measurable capital flight after 2022 increases
- Administrative complexity with illiquid asset valuation

**France (Abandoned):**
- Repealed wealth tax in 2017
- Generated less than 0.2% of GDP before repeal
- Cited capital flight and economic impact as reasons

**Key Lesson:** Most wealth among the very rich is held in private businesses, real estate, art, and trusts—all illiquid and difficult to value. This creates administrative challenges for unrealized gains taxation.

### 4. Hybrid Approaches

**Netherlands 2028 Proposed System:**
The Netherlands is developing a **hybrid approach**:
- **Capital Growth Tax**: Applied to most assets (stocks, bonds) based on unrealized gains/losses
- **Capital Gains Tax**: Applied only on realization for real estate and start-up shares
- Rationale: Avoid taxation on less liquid assets where annual valuation creates hardship
- Implementation target: January 1, 2028

**Note:** Despite negative advice from the Council of State, the Bill on Actual Returns in Box 3 was submitted in May 2025. Government acknowledges "diminished service, limited opportunities for preliminary consultation and insufficient monitoring during a period of three to five years" after implementation.

**International Context:** No other surveyed country has adopted this specific hybrid model, making the Netherlands an experiment in this approach.

### 5. Competitiveness Effects and Capital Flows

**Capital Mobility in 2025:**
- Capital is highly mobile in the globalized economy
- Businesses and investors seek highest after-tax returns
- Investors prioritize low-tax, high-growth jurisdictions (Dubai, Switzerland)
- Policy signals drive rapid wealth responses

**UK Case Study (2025):**
- Tax reforms triggered exodus of 16,500 millionaires in 2025
- $91.8B in assets leaving the country
- New 2% wealth tax, increased capital gains tax alignment, 20% exit tax
- Demonstrates high sensitivity of mobile capital to tax policy changes

**Preferred Destinations:**
- **Dubai**: Low/no taxation, high growth
- **Switzerland**: Established wealth tax system but competitive rates, no federal capital gains tax
- **Belgium**: No capital gains tax for private investors
- **Singapore**: Territorial tax system, no capital gains tax

**Norwegian Experience:**
- 2022 wealth tax increase led to measurable emigration to Switzerland and UK
- However, actual migration was lower than feared (0.01% of richest households)
- Economic modeling estimates 1.3% long-run output reduction (Princeton economist Christine Blandhol)

### 6. Tax Competition and Race to the Bottom

**Current Dynamics:**
- **Global minimum corporate tax**: 138 jurisdictions agreed to 15% minimum for large multinationals (implemented 2024-2025)
- **Personal wealth taxation**: No coordination, high variation between countries
- **Capital gains rates in Europe 2025**: Range from 0% (Belgium for private investors) to 34% (France)
- Average European capital gains tax rate: 16.4%; EU average: 17.6%

**Race to Bottom Concerns:**
- No evidence of coordinated "race to bottom" in personal capital taxation
- Instead: Significant variation based on national priorities
- Some countries increasing rates (UK, Estonia, Italy for crypto)
- Others maintaining competitive exemptions (Belgium, Germany time-based)

**Opportunities:**
- Countries with competitive rates can attract mobile capital
- Belgium's zero rate for private investors positions it favorably
- Switzerland maintains attractiveness despite wealth taxes through cantonal competition

### 7. EU Context and Coordination

**Limited Harmonization:**
- Tax policy remains national competence in the EU
- Treaties provide no general harmonization power for direct taxation
- Progress has been slow, reflecting Member States' reluctance to give up fiscal sovereignty

**Recent EU Developments (2025):**
- European Parliament published comprehensive study on future of EU tax policy harmonization
- Focus on wealth taxation and coordination mechanisms rather than full rate harmonization
- Proposals for common definitions, interoperable reporting systems, minimum administrative standards
- Recognition that fragmentation in wealth taxation results in lost revenues and unequal treatment

**EU Competitiveness Context:**
- Denmark, Norway (not EU), and Netherlands levy highest 2025 capital gains tax rates in Europe
- Most EU Member States tax capital income separately from labor income at more beneficial rates
- Debate extends beyond labor income to capital gains, property, gift, inheritance, and wealth taxes

**Netherlands' Position:**
- Netherlands' proposed system diverges significantly from EU peers
- Only three EU countries (Spain, plus non-EU Norway and Switzerland) have comprehensive wealth taxes
- France and Italy levy wealth taxes only on selected assets
- Netherlands' capital growth tax would be unique even within EU context

### 8. Migration Patterns and Wealthy Individual Mobility

**Evidence of Tax-Driven Migration:**

**UK (2025 - Most Dramatic):**
- 16,500 millionaires leaving in 2025
- Autumn 2024 Budget reforms accelerated exodus
- Destinations: Dubai, Switzerland, Singapore
- UK experiencing highest wealth loss globally in 2025

**Norway:**
- Post-2022 wealth tax increase: Measured emigration to Switzerland and UK
- Research shows 0.01% of richest households relocated (lower than feared)
- But still represents meaningful capital outflow

**General Pattern:**
- Just 0.01% of richest households relocated in Norway, Sweden, Denmark after wealth tax reforms
- Suggests migration threat may be overstated
- However, small percentages of ultra-wealthy represent large absolute capital amounts

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Many wealthy individuals prioritize location factors beyond taxation
- Family ties, business connections, quality of life matter
- Mobility threat may be rhetorical tool rather than dominant reality

**Netherlands-Specific Risk:**
- EU freedom of movement makes migration easier
- Neighboring countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany) offer alternatives
- Geographic proximity reduces relocation barriers
- High-quality alternatives readily available

### 9. Recent Trends and Reforms (2024-2025)

**Countries Increasing Taxation:**
- **UK**: Capital gains tax 20% → 24% (2025)
- **Estonia**: Adding 2% defense tax, CGT rising from 22% to 24% (2026)
- **Belgium**: Ending tax exclusion, applying 10% rate (2026)
- **Italy**: Crypto CGT 26% → 33% (2026)
- **France**: New 20% minimum tax for high earners (2025)

**Countries Maintaining/Reducing:**
- **Czech Republic**: Applied 23% solidarity tax to long-term capital gains (2025), but committed to reverse (2026)
- **Belgium**: Still maintaining zero rate for non-professional private investors (until 2026 changes)
- **Germany**: Maintaining time-based exemption system

**Trend Analysis:**
- **Mixed picture**: No clear global trend toward either increasing or decreasing capital gains taxation
- **Country-specific**: Reforms reflect national fiscal needs and political priorities
- **Asset-specific**: Increasing focus on emerging assets (crypto) as tax base
- **Revenue pressure**: Some increases driven by fiscal consolidation needs (defense spending, pandemic recovery)

## Confidence

**High** - This assessment is based on:
- Comprehensive OECD data on 33+ countries
- Recent 2025 Tax Foundation and OECD publications
- Multiple country-specific examples with detailed rate information
- Academic research on wealth taxation effectiveness
- Real-world migration data from 2024-2025 reforms
- Multiple corroborating sources on Netherlands' uniqueness

The conclusion that the Netherlands' system is internationally unique and that realized gains taxation is the overwhelming global norm is supported by consistent evidence across multiple authoritative sources.

## Caveats

1. **Data Recency**: Tax systems are actively changing (2024-2026 reforms), so some information may become outdated
2. **Implementation Unknown**: Netherlands' 2028 system is proposed but not yet implemented; actual effects unknown
3. **Causation vs Correlation**: Difficult to isolate tax effects from other factors driving migration
4. **Migration Research Limitations**: Some studies show minimal migration (0.01%), others show significant outflows (UK); context matters
5. **Valuation Challenges**: Illiquid asset valuation remains unsolved problem for unrealized gains taxation globally
6. **EU Dynamics**: Future EU coordination efforts could change landscape significantly
7. **Behavioral Responses**: Taxpayers may adapt through legal avoidance rather than migration
8. **Revenue Effectiveness**: Wealth taxes generate modest revenues (typically <2% of total) despite administrative complexity
9. **Sub-National Variation**: Some countries (Switzerland, Spain) have regional variation not fully captured here
10. **Emerging Assets**: Crypto and digital assets creating new taxation challenges not yet settled internationally
