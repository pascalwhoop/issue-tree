# Sub-Problem: Legal and Political Feasibility

## Question
What are the legal constraints (including court rulings on the current system) and political considerations that affect the feasibility of implementing each taxation system?

## Context
This sub-problem supports the parent question: "Should the Netherlands adopt a realized gains style of investment taxation, or maintain its current system of taxing unrealized gains?"

Recent Dutch court rulings have challenged aspects of the Box 3 system, creating legal pressure for reform. Political feasibility determines whether any proposed changes can actually be implemented.

## Acceptance Criteria
A thorough analysis covering:
- **Court rulings**: What have Dutch courts said about Box 3?
- **Legal requirements**: What constraints do court decisions impose?
- **Constitutional issues**: Any fundamental legal barriers?
- **Political landscape**: Which parties support which approaches?
- **Coalition dynamics**: What is politically achievable?
- **Public opinion**: What do Dutch citizens and stakeholders think?
- **Transition planning**: Legal/political path from current to alternative system
- **Implementation timeline**: Realistic timeframe for any changes

## Key Considerations
- Supreme Court rulings on deemed return system
- European Court of Human Rights considerations
- Property rights and taxation legality
- Political parties' stated positions
- Interest group positions (investors, pensioners, business groups)
- Recent parliamentary debates and proposals
- Transition complexity and political will
- Grandfathering and phase-in options
