# Analysis

## Problem Understanding

The question asks whether the United States should pursue annexation of Greenland - a complex geopolitical question with legal, political, economic, strategic, ethical, and diplomatic dimensions.

## Why Decompose

This problem cannot be answered through direct research because it requires:

1. **Multiple distinct analytical frameworks**: Legal analysis differs fundamentally from economic analysis, which differs from ethical considerations
2. **Diverse information sources**: Each dimension requires different types of research (international law, economic data, strategic military analysis, indigenous rights frameworks, diplomatic precedents)
3. **Interdependent but separable questions**: While the sub-problems inform each other, each can be researched independently
4. **Comprehensive evaluation required**: The success criteria explicitly demands assessment across multiple dimensions

Attempting to solve this directly would result in superficial analysis across too many domains.

## Sub-Problems Identified

I'm decomposing this into 6 sub-problems:

### 1. Legal Feasibility
**Question**: Under international law, what legal mechanisms exist for territorial acquisition, and how would they apply to Greenland?

**Rationale**: Must understand whether acquisition is legally possible before considering whether it's advisable.

### 2. Political Feasibility
**Question**: What is the political likelihood and willingness from the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland for such annexation?

**Rationale**: Even if legally possible, political reality determines feasibility. Requires analyzing domestic politics in all three jurisdictions.

### 3. Strategic Value
**Question**: What strategic and military benefits would the U.S. gain from controlling Greenland?

**Rationale**: Core rationale for acquisition would be strategic positioning - need to quantify Arctic access, military bases, and geopolitical positioning benefits.

### 4. Economic Analysis
**Question**: What are the economic costs, benefits, and resource implications of U.S. acquisition of Greenland?

**Rationale**: Must understand financial burden, resource wealth, infrastructure needs, and fiscal reality.

### 5. Self-Determination and Indigenous Rights
**Question**: How does potential U.S. annexation align with Greenlandic self-determination and indigenous Inuit rights?

**Rationale**: Ethical dimension is critical - Greenland has indigenous population with self-governance. Cannot ignore their agency and rights.

### 6. Geopolitical Implications
**Question**: What would be the international diplomatic consequences and geopolitical ramifications of U.S. annexation?

**Rationale**: Action wouldn't occur in vacuum - must understand impact on international relations, precedents set, reactions from other powers.

## Integration Plan

Once all sub-problems are solved, synthesis will:
- Weigh legal and political feasibility as threshold questions
- Balance strategic/economic benefits against costs
- Evaluate against ethical framework of self-determination
- Consider whether geopolitical consequences outweigh benefits
- Provide clear recommendation with reasoning
