# Problem: Should the United States Annex Greenland?

## Question
Should the United States pursue and complete the annexation of Greenland, making it a U.S. territory or state?

## Context
Greenland is currently an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, with Denmark handling foreign affairs and defense. The question of U.S. acquisition has periodically surfaced in political discourse, most notably in recent years.

Key contextual factors:
- Greenland has significant strategic importance (Arctic access, military positioning)
- Rich in natural resources (rare earth minerals, potential oil/gas reserves)
- Climate change is opening new Arctic shipping routes and access
- Greenland has ~56,000 inhabitants, primarily indigenous Inuit
- Current self-governance with ongoing discussions about full independence from Denmark
- Geopolitical considerations with Russia and China's Arctic interests

## Success Criteria
A comprehensive analysis that:
- Evaluates feasibility (legal, political, diplomatic)
- Assesses strategic and economic implications for all parties
- Considers Greenlandic self-determination and indigenous rights
- Weighs geopolitical consequences
- Examines historical precedents and international law
- Provides a reasoned conclusion based on multiple dimensions of analysis

## Notes
This is a complex geopolitical question involving sovereignty, indigenous rights, international relations, economics, military strategy, and environmental considerations. The analysis should be balanced and consider perspectives from the U.S., Denmark, Greenland, and the international community.
