# Problem Tree: U.S. Greenland Annexation

## Root Problem
Should the United States pursue and complete the annexation of Greenland?

This problem tree will recursively decompose and analyze the multi-faceted question of whether U.S. annexation of Greenland would be advisable, considering legal, political, economic, strategic, ethical, and geopolitical dimensions.

## Structure
This is a recursive problem-solving tree. Each node can either:
- Be decomposed into sub-problems (creates subproblems/ folder)
- Be solved directly (creates SOLUTION.md)

## Files
- `PROBLEM.md` - The problem/question at this node
- `STATUS.md` - Current status (pending/decomposed/solving/solved)
- `ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis and reasoning (created by solver)
- `SOLUTION.md` - The answer (created when solved)
- `subproblems/` - Child problem nodes (if decomposed)

## Usage
To work on this problem tree:
```bash
cd us-greenland-annexation
claude -p "Use /solve-node skill"
```

Or invoke the solve-node skill directly from within this directory.

## Current Status
See STATUS.md for current state.
