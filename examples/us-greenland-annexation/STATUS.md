## Process

Decomposed into 6 sub-problems, all solved and synthesized:
1. legal-feasibility - SOLVED
2. political-feasibility - SOLVED
3. strategic-value - SOLVED
4. economic-analysis - SOLVED
5. self-determination-indigenous-rights - SOLVED
6. geopolitical-implications - SOLVED (via 4 sub-sub-problems)

## Conclusion

**No, the United States should not annex Greenland.**

After comprehensive analysis, the case against annexation is overwhelming:
- Legally possible but politically impossible (85% Greenlandic opposition, 78% Danish opposition)
- Economically unfavorable ($245B net cost over 15 years)
- Strategically unnecessary (U.S. already has access via existing agreements)
- Ethically indefensible without consent (violates self-determination)
- Geopolitically catastrophic (would destroy NATO and undermine international order)

The U.S. would trade the foundation of its global power for territory it already effectively influences.
