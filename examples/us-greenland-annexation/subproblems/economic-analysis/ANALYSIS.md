# Economic Analysis - Research Plan

## Problem Understanding

I need to analyze the economic dimensions of a potential U.S. acquisition of Greenland, including:
- Acquisition costs (purchase price or compensation)
- Ongoing governance costs (replacing Danish subsidies)
- Infrastructure development needs
- Natural resource wealth and extraction feasibility
- Strategic resource value
- Cost-benefit analysis from U.S. perspective
- Economic impact on Greenlandic residents

## Research Approach

### 1. Current Economic Baseline
- Danish subsidy levels and composition
- Greenland's current GDP and economic structure
- Existing infrastructure state
- Population and economic indicators

### 2. Acquisition Costs
- Historical precedents (Alaska, Virgin Islands, etc.)
- Potential compensation to Denmark
- Negotiation and legal costs

### 3. Infrastructure Investment
- Ports and harbors
- Airports and aviation
- Telecommunications
- Energy systems
- Roads and internal transport
- Healthcare and education facilities

### 4. Natural Resources
- Rare earth minerals (types, quantities, value)
- Oil and gas potential
- Fisheries
- Other mineral resources
- Extraction costs and feasibility

### 5. Ongoing Costs
- Governance and administration
- Defense and security
- Social services and subsidies
- Economic development programs

### 6. Economic Benefits
- Resource revenues
- Strategic positioning value
- Economic development potential
- Trade and shipping benefits

## Research Sources
- Academic studies on Greenland's economy
- Danish government subsidy data
- U.S. Geological Survey reports on resources
- Economic analyses and think tank reports
- Historical acquisition cost data

## Methodology
- Use multiple sources for verification
- Provide ranges where exact figures unavailable
- Consider both short-term and long-term costs/benefits
- Account for uncertainty in resource estimates
