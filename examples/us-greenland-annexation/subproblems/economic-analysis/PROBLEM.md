# Sub-Problem: Economic Analysis of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Question
What are the economic costs, benefits, and resource implications of U.S. acquisition of Greenland?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the economic dimension of the parent question: "Should the United States annex Greenland?"

Key economic considerations:

- Natural resource wealth (rare earth minerals, potential oil/gas, fisheries)
- Strategic resource value in global supply chains
- Economic benefits to Greenlandic population
- U.S. fiscal capacity and budget implications

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Estimates potential acquisition costs or compensation
- Analyzes current Danish subsidies and what U.S. would need to provide
- Evaluates infrastructure investment needs (ports, airports, telecommunications, etc.)
- Assesses natural resource wealth and extraction feasibility
- Examines rare earth minerals and strategic resource value
- Considers economic development potential and costs
- Provides cost-benefit analysis from U.S. fiscal perspective
