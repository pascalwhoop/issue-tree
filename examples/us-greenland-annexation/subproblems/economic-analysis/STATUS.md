## Summary

Comprehensive economic analysis completed covering:
- Acquisition cost estimates ($50-200B most likely)
- Ongoing governance costs ($1.6-2.6B annually)
- Infrastructure investment needs ($12-111B over 15 years)
- Natural resource valuation ($186B extractable, $4.4T potential)
- Cost-benefit analysis (net cost of ~$245B over 15 years)
- Economic impact on Greenlandic residents
- U.S. fiscal capacity assessment

## Conclusion

Economic case shows high upfront and ongoing costs with uncertain long-term benefits heavily dependent on successful resource extraction that is currently economically challenging. Strategic considerations likely drive interest more than pure economics.
