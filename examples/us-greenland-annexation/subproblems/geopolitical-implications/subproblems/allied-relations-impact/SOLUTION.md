# Solution: Allied Relations Impact

## Answer

**A U.S. annexation of Greenland would be catastrophic for U.S. alliances, likely ending NATO as a functional military alliance and causing severe, lasting damage to transatlantic relations.** Both Danish officials and international experts agree that any forced acquisition would represent an existential crisis for the alliance, fundamentally undermining the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and mutual trust upon which NATO is built.

The damage would be severe even in a hypothetical consensual scenario, though current evidence shows neither Denmark nor Greenland is willing to negotiate any transfer of sovereignty.

## Evidence

### 1. Danish Government and Public Reaction

**Official Danish Position:**
- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated unequivocally that "Greenland is not for sale" and called the 2019 Trump proposal "absurd"
- In 2026, Frederiksen warned that a U.S. takeover of Greenland "would mark the end of NATO" and would be "the end of everything"
- Denmark's Defense Intelligence Service took the unprecedented step of identifying the United States as a security threat in its December 2024 annual risk assessment, describing the U.S. as "using its economic and technological strength as an instrument of power, including toward allies and partners"

**Public Opinion:**
- 78% of Danes oppose selling Greenland to the United States (YouGov poll, January 2025)
- 41% of Danes now view the United States as a threat, representing a seismic shift in one of Europe's historically most pro-American nations
- 85% of Greenlanders oppose leaving the Danish Realm to become part of the United States (only 6% support it)

**Historical Context:**
The 2019 Trump proposal and subsequent cancellation of his state visit 14 days before it was scheduled was perceived by everyone in Denmark as a grave insult. After Trump called Frederiksen's rejection "nasty," the Danish government worked overtime to convince the U.S. government about its backing as an ally.

### 2. Impact on U.S.-Denmark Bilateral Relations

**Military Cooperation at Risk:**
Denmark has been an exceptionally loyal U.S. military partner:
- 43 Danish soldiers died in Afghanistan (37 in combat), representing the highest per capita casualties among coalition forces
- Danish troops operated "without caveat" in Helmand Province, with President Obama personally thanking Denmark for "extraordinary contributions"
- Denmark was the first non-U.S., non-British coalition member to suffer casualties in Iraq
- Denmark recently approved a Defense Cooperation Agreement (DCA) in June 2025 (94-11 vote) granting the U.S. extended access to three Danish air bases

**Intelligence Sharing:**
- The DCA strengthens bilateral intelligence-sharing and Arctic defense cooperation
- Denmark cooperates with U.S. intelligence agencies on counterespionage operations
- This cooperation would be immediately jeopardized by any acquisition attempt

**Strategic Assets:**
- The U.S. operates Pituffik Space Base in Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement with Denmark, providing missile warning, missile defense, and space surveillance for the U.S. and NATO
- Loss of Danish cooperation could complicate continued U.S. access to this critical facility

### 3. NATO Alliance Cohesion

**Article 5 Crisis:**
- NATO's Article 5 states that "an attack against one Ally is an attack against all"
- While Article 5 has never been designed to handle conflict between members, legal experts note that other NATO allies would still be bound to defend Denmark's territorial integrity
- Senator Chris Murphy stated: "It would be the end of NATO" if the U.S. annexed Greenland
- Denmark's former NATO ambassador condemned Trump's bid as "American imperialism"

**Unprecedented Alliance Challenge:**
- No NATO member has ever threatened military action against another member state since the alliance's founding in 1949
- NATO's 1995 Study on Enlargement makes clear that settling territorial disputes peacefully is a prerequisite for membership
- Historical intra-alliance disputes (Greece-Turkey over Cyprus, Greece-Macedonia naming dispute) were handled diplomatically, never through territorial seizure

**Expert Assessments:**
- Chatham House: "Changes to US policy under Trump risk undermining the credibility of the US commitment to NATO's Article 5 guarantee"
- University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer: Combining Ukraine with Greenland "would basically ruin the alliance," leaving NATO as "a shadow of itself"
- Atlantic Council: The stance "risks dissolving the transatlantic community and ending the most successful military alliance in history"
- Multiple experts agree that "any US military action against Greenland would likely spell the end of NATO"

### 4. European Allied Reactions

**Unified European Opposition:**
Leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement with Danish PM Frederiksen declaring: "It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland."

Key individual reactions:
- French President Macron: "I cannot imagine a scenario in which the United States of America would be placed in a position to violate Danish sovereignty"
- The statement emphasized "Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders"

**EU Response:**
- The European Union reaffirmed solidarity with Denmark and Greenland
- EU foreign policy spokesperson stated the bloc was committed to defending the territorial integrity of its members
- Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union could potentially allow Denmark to seek assistance from other EU members if it faced aggression from a NATO ally

**Strategic Implications:**
- European countries are now considering "what NATO without the US would look like"
- Chatham House suggests European countries could respond by refusing to refuel US ships in European ports, not accepting injured military personnel, and demanding high payments for continued US troop stationing
- European leaders "basically think that the United States is not really an ally anymore, and they also think that the United States is ready to breach international law instead of defending it"

### 5. Broader U.S.-European Relations

**Credibility on International Law and Sovereignty:**
- A U.S. acquisition attempt would severely undermine U.S. credibility on territorial integrity issues, particularly regarding Ukraine
- As one analysis noted: "A US posture of allowing US interests to override international law poses a normative challenge for NATO, which has described itself as based on democracy and rule of law - the same basis for NATO's criticism of Russian actions against Ukraine"
- "European hesitation to condemn US violations of international law undermines Europe's credibility when invoking the 'rules-based order' against Russia and its actions in Ukraine"
- Russian commentators have already noted the hypocrisy: "The Americans have shown that agreements, sovereignty, and international law don't matter when they decide they want something"

**Trust Erosion:**
- The U.S. has been summoned by Denmark after reports that intelligence officials were instructed to collect intelligence on Greenland's independence movement
- Long-term damage to transatlantic relations would extend beyond just military alliance to economic, diplomatic, and cultural ties

### 6. Potential Retaliatory Measures

**Diplomatic Costs:**
- Immediate cooling of bilateral relations with Denmark
- Strain on U.S. relations with all Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland)
- Reduced European cooperation on global issues (China policy, Middle East, climate)

**Military Cooperation:**
- Loss of intelligence-sharing arrangements
- Reduced access to Danish military facilities and those of other European allies
- Complications for U.S. military operations that rely on European logistics and support
- Potential expulsion of U.S. forces from European bases

**Economic Measures:**
- Potential sanctions or economic countermeasures from EU
- Disruption of U.S.-EU trade relations
- Reduced European investment in the United States

### 7. Consensual vs. Coercive Acquisition Scenarios

**Current Reality - No Consent Available:**
- Neither Denmark nor Greenland is willing to negotiate any transfer of sovereignty
- Officials have made clear "both publicly and privately that they will not even entertain conversations about any mechanism that could enable the sale of Greenland to the US"
- Any lawful acquisition "presumes a willing sovereign partner, which is absent in the Greenland case"

**Hypothetical Consensual Scenario:**
Even if Denmark and Greenland were willing to negotiate (which they are not), such a transfer would:
- Still damage European perceptions of U.S. respect for small ally interests
- Raise questions about U.S. pressure tactics or inducements used to obtain consent
- Set a concerning precedent for territorial transfers between allies
- Require years of negotiations, constitutional amendments in Denmark, and Greenlandic referendum

**Forced or Pressure-Based Acquisition:**
This scenario would:
- Definitively end NATO as a functional alliance
- Unite Europe against the United States
- Trigger Article 42.7 EU mutual defense considerations
- Permanently damage U.S. credibility on international law and sovereignty
- Provide propaganda victories to Russia and China
- Isolate the United States diplomatically

### 8. Historical Context

**Previous U.S. Interest:**
- The U.S. offered to purchase Greenland in 1946 for $100 million; Denmark refused
- Historical precedents (Alaska Purchase from Russia in 1867, Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803) involved willing sellers and occurred in different geopolitical contexts
- No modern precedent exists for forcible territorial acquisition between allied democracies

**Denmark's Alliance Loyalty:**
Denmark has historically been one of the most reliable U.S. allies, with:
- Founding NATO membership since 1949
- High-casualty military deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq
- Recently increased defense spending to 2.37% of GDP (2024)
- Consistent support for U.S. foreign policy objectives

## Confidence

**High Confidence** in the assessment that forced acquisition would end NATO and cause severe allied relations damage.

**High Confidence** that current Danish and Greenlandic opposition makes consensual transfer impossible without fundamental changes in their positions.

**Medium-High Confidence** in specific retaliatory measures, as exact European responses would depend on circumstances and evolving political dynamics.

The evidence base is strong, drawing from:
- Multiple official government statements from Denmark, Greenland, and European leaders
- Recent polling data (2025-2026)
- Expert analysis from major think tanks (Chatham House, Atlantic Council, CEPA)
- NATO treaty provisions and alliance history
- Documented military cooperation records

## Caveats

1. **Analysis assumes forced or pressure-based acquisition**: If some unforeseeable change led Denmark and Greenland to genuinely support transfer, impacts would be somewhat reduced (though still significant).

2. **NATO response complexity**: The exact mechanics of how NATO would respond to member-on-member aggression are unprecedented and uncertain.

3. **Long-term unpredictability**: While immediate damage is certain, the long-term evolution of alliances is difficult to predict with precision.

4. **Scenario dependence**: The degree of damage would vary based on:
   - Whether military force was used or merely threatened
   - How the international community framed the action
   - U.S. justifications and diplomatic approach
   - Greenlandic population's response

5. **Alternative arrangements**: The analysis focuses on full annexation; alternative arrangements (expanded basing, sovereignty agreements) would have different allied relations impacts.

6. **Political changes**: Future changes in Danish, Greenlandic, or U.S. leadership could alter dynamics, though current evidence shows broad consensus against transfer.
