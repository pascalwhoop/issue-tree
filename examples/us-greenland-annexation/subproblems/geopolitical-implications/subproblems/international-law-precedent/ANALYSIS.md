# Analysis: International Law and Precedent

## Problem Understanding

The question asks what precedent a U.S. acquisition of Greenland would set for 21st century territorial sovereignty and how it would affect international legal norms and the rules-based international order.

This is fundamentally about whether such an acquisition could be legally legitimate and what signals it would send to the international community about the viability of great power territorial expansion in the modern era.

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This is a focused legal and normative analysis question that can be answered through comprehensive research on:
- International law principles (UN Charter, self-determination)
- Recent territorial disputes and their legal treatment
- Historical precedents for territorial transfers
- Expert legal analysis on territorial sovereignty norms
- UN and international community responses to territorial changes

The question is specific enough to answer directly without requiring sub-problems.

## Research Plan

1. **UN Charter and International Law Foundations**
   - Research UN Charter provisions on territorial integrity and self-determination
   - Examine International Court of Justice opinions on territorial sovereignty
   - Review international law principles governing territorial transfers

2. **Recent 21st Century Precedents**
   - Crimea annexation (2014) and international response
   - South China Sea territorial disputes
   - Kosovo independence (2008)
   - Other relevant cases

3. **Historical Territorial Purchases**
   - Alaska Purchase (1867)
   - U.S. Virgin Islands Purchase (1917)
   - Louisiana Purchase (1803)
   - Their legal frameworks and contemporary context

4. **Self-Determination Requirements**
   - Greenland's home rule status
   - Role of referenda in territorial changes
   - Consent requirements under international law

5. **Expert Legal Analysis**
   - International law scholars' perspectives
   - UN statements on territorial sovereignty
   - Analysis from think tanks and policy institutes

6. **Precedent-Setting Implications**
   - What signal this would send to other disputes
   - Impact on norms against territorial expansion
   - Differential treatment based on power dynamics

## Expected Findings

I anticipate finding that:
- Modern international law heavily disfavors territorial acquisition by force but has ambiguous treatment of consensual transfers
- Self-determination of Greenland's population would be critical to legal legitimacy
- Even if technically legal, it could undermine norms against great power territorial expansion
- Different regions/nations would view it through different lenses based on their interests
- The precedent could be invoked in other disputes regardless of legal distinctions
