# Sub-Problem: International Law and Precedent

## Question
What precedent would U.S. acquisition of Greenland set for territorial sovereignty in the 21st century, and how would it affect international legal norms and the rules-based international order?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the international law, norms, and precedent-setting dimension of the geopolitical implications question.

The parent problem is: "What would be the international diplomatic consequences and geopolitical ramifications of U.S. annexation of Greenland?"

The post-World War II international order is built on principles of territorial integrity, sovereign equality, and self-determination enshrined in the UN Charter. Territorial changes in the 21st century have been controversial (Crimea 2014, various disputes). How Greenland's status might change would set precedents for international law and norms.

Key considerations:
- UN Charter principles on territorial integrity and self-determination
- Precedent for great power territorial acquisition in 21st century
- Comparison to recent territorial disputes (Crimea, South China Sea, etc.)
- Impact on rules-based international order
- Self-determination principles vs. sale/transfer of territory
- Role of consent (Denmark, Greenland, international community)
- International Court of Justice implications
- UN Security Council dynamics
- Precedent effects on other territorial disputes globally
- Impact on international law development
- Legitimacy questions and global South perspectives
- Historical parallels (Alaska purchase, Virgin Islands, etc.) and their relevance

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Evaluates consistency with UN Charter and international law principles
- Assesses what precedent this would set for territorial changes
- Analyzes likely UN responses (Security Council, General Assembly)
- Examines comparison to recent territorial disputes and annexations
- Considers self-determination and consent requirements
- Evaluates impact on rules-based international order credibility
- Assesses how different regions/nations would view the precedent
- Examines potential for other disputes to cite this as precedent
- Identifies relevant historical parallels and their applicability
- Evaluates whether acquisition could be legally legitimate or would violate norms
- Provides evidence from international law analysis, UN proceedings, and expert legal assessments
