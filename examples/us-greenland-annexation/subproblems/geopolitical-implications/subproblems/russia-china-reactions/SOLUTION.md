# Solution: Russia-China Strategic Reactions

## Answer

Russia and China would respond to U.S. acquisition of Greenland with a combination of strategic silence, opportunistic exploitation of NATO divisions, accelerated Arctic militarization, and coordinated (though tension-filled) diplomatic positioning—but would likely avoid direct military confrontation. The responses would be fundamentally different in character: Russia would exploit the move to deepen transatlantic divisions while accelerating Arctic military buildup, while China would leverage the precedent to challenge U.S. credibility on "rules-based order" rhetoric while pragmatically protecting its own Arctic interests. The net effect would be significant escalation of great power competition in the Arctic, increased militarization, and heightened risks of miscalculation and conflict.

## Evidence

### Russian Strategic and Military Responses

**1. Strategic Silence and Exploitation of NATO Divisions**

Contrary to expectations of immediate vocal opposition, Russia has been notably silent about Trump's Greenland annexation threats. The Kremlin has not officially commented on Trump's Greenland ambitions, despite Putin's March 2025 statements expressing concern about "NATO countries increasingly often designating the Far North as a springboard for possible conflicts."

Expert analysis reveals Russia's actual strategy: Putin would be "delighted to see further divisions and incoherence in NATO and a massive transatlantic crisis." If the U.S. were "tied up in the Western Hemisphere," this would give Russia more space to increase its influence in Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Europe. This assessment was reinforced by evidence that Russia circulated a forged letter in 2019 requesting funds for a Greenland independence referendum with U.S. politicians, indicating the Kremlin aims to sow discord between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States.

**2. Arctic Military Buildup Acceleration**

Russia has already been dramatically expanding its Arctic military presence, and U.S. annexation of Greenland would provide justification for further escalation:

- **Nuclear submarine expansion**: President Putin announced that over the past six years, the Russian Navy has commissioned five Borei-A class strategic missile submarines and four Yasen-M class nuclear-powered multipurpose attack submarines. As of 2025, Russia operates eight of the modern Borei class SSBNs.

- **Arctic base infrastructure**: Russia possesses 32 military bases in the Arctic that are staffed year-round, compared to 10 for the United States. Russia is constructing additional military installations and power plants in the Arctic region.

- **Kola Peninsula arsenal**: One of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located on the Kola peninsula, pointed towards Norway, the UK, and over the pole towards Canada and the U.S. Norway has detected increased weapons development in this region.

- **Northern Fleet significance**: The fact that the Russian Navy is severely constrained in the Black and Baltic Seas further increases the Northern Fleet's relative importance for the Kremlin. Russia's fleet of nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines is roughly equally divided between the Northern Fleet in the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Fleet.

**3. Diplomatic Messaging and Escalatory Posture**

At the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk in March 2025, Putin stated that "Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we will closely follow the developments and mount an appropriate response by increasing our military capability and modernising military infrastructure." He also expressed concerns about U.S. intentions to "advance its geo-strategic, military-political and economic interests in the Arctic."

**4. Resource Competition and Chinese Partnership**

Russia has been working with China to develop Arctic shipping routes as Moscow seeks to deliver more oil and gas to China amid Western sanctions. This partnership would likely intensify as a counterweight to U.S. Arctic dominance, though significant tensions exist (discussed below).

### Chinese Strategic and Diplomatic Responses

**1. "Rules-Based Order" Rhetoric and Diplomatic Positioning**

China would seize on U.S. annexation of Greenland as a major propaganda and diplomatic victory, undermining American credibility on international law and territorial sovereignty:

- **Hypocrisy narrative**: China argues that U.S. rhetoric about a "rules-based international order" is misleading, claiming the U.S. is attempting to replace the UN-established order from 1945. A forcible annexation would provide powerful evidence for this narrative.

- **Sovereignty principles**: China's foreign policy officially emphasizes the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, including "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity" and "non-interference in internal affairs." U.S. annexation would allow China to position itself as a defender of these principles.

- **UN forum exploitation**: China would use the UN as a forum to condemn the annexation and draw parallels to its own territorial claims, arguing that if the U.S. can acquire Greenland, China's claims in the South China Sea and over Taiwan are equally legitimate.

**2. Polar Silk Road Strategy Adjustments**

China's Arctic approach has been formalized since its 2018 White Paper on Arctic Policy, which outlined China's strategic objectives and framed its identity as a "near-Arctic state":

- **Infrastructure investments**: China is slowly building up its capacities in the Arctic region and using all tools of soft power to establish itself as a legitimate Arctic stakeholder. Integration of Arctic strategy into national and subnational planning is matched by material investments in polar technology—such as icebreakers and shipbuilding—signaling a long-term bid for autonomous access and influence under its Polar Silk Road (PSR) vision.

- **Observer to stakeholder transition**: The sum of China's Arctic activities—commercial, scientific, diplomatic—points toward a singular objective: to move from observer to indispensable stakeholder, doing so not by seeking territorial claims or military footholds, but by embedding itself in the Arctic's material and institutional systems.

- **Russian dependency deepening**: China continues to deepen cooperation with Russia in the Arctic, especially as its broader efforts to establish port-related partnerships in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden, and Greenland have faced political and security roadblocks. U.S. annexation would further close off Western Arctic partnerships, pushing China toward Russia.

**3. Military Presence Expansion**

China has been accelerating its Arctic military footprint:

- **Joint naval operations**: In 2024, China and Russia conducted their first joint naval patrol in the Arctic Ocean, marking a significant expansion of military cooperation. China's Coast Guard entered Arctic Ocean waters for the first time in a joint patrol with Russian forces.

- **Exercise frequency**: In 2024 alone, China and Russia conducted 11 joint exercises—more than in any previous year. Through June 2025, China and Russia have held at least 113 joint military exercises. Reports indicate Moscow and Beijing will conduct annual naval exercises in the Arctic.

- **Icebreaker deployment**: Three Chinese icebreakers were deployed in the Arctic in late 2024. The U.S. Department of Defense produced a report in early 2025 expressing concerns about Chinese military activity in the Arctic.

- **Long-term strategic goals**: In the long run, Beijing seeks a deeper strategic foothold in the Arctic, one that could include joint-use military and logistical bases with Russia.

### Russia-China Coordination: Partnership with Limits

**1. Joint Diplomatic Positioning**

When Xi Jinping and Putin meet, Arctic collaboration surfaces with clockwork regularity—in every joint statement issued during their state visits since February 2022, including the summit in Moscow for the 80th anniversary of Victory Day in 2025. In May 2025, the fourth meeting of the Russian-Chinese Working Group on Arctic Cooperation took place, with the two powers releasing a statement declaring that "maintaining the Arctic as a peaceful arena for cooperation" was of great significance to both powers.

What began as political signaling is now becoming reality through joint drills in the Arctic Ocean and growing military-technological cooperation, new bilateral Arctic governance formats, and intensified use of Arctic shipping lanes on the Northern Sea Route.

**2. Fundamental Strategic Tensions**

Despite public cooperation, significant underlying tensions limit Russia-China coordination:

- **Arctic governance divergence**: Russia and China both want to engage in multilateral cooperation in the Arctic, but disagree on who to cooperate with and how. China would like to see the Arctic Council restored with its observer state prerogatives, while Russia has entertained the idea to "globalize" the Arctic on its own terms. China likely obstructed Russia's attempts to politicize the Arctic activities of BRICS+ throughout 2022 and 2023.

- **Trust deficits**: In 2025, the New York Times obtained an internal FSB planning document detailing Moscow's concerns about Chinese intelligence agents carrying out espionage in the Arctic using mining firms and university research centers as cover. China and Russia are in a phase of "high distrust" with each other, especially in the military sphere.

- **Economic cooperation limits**: In December 2023, CNPC and CNOOC pulled out of the Arctic LNG 2 project in response to tightening U.S. sanctions. While China continued to fulfill Russia's technology orders for energy projects in the Arctic, it has refrained from investing further in Russia's Arctic initiatives out of fear of sanctions.

- **Competing relationships**: China genuinely values its relationships with the Arctic's other powers and does not want to risk alienating them by getting overly close to Russia. Their relationship is characterized by pragmatism and situational cooperation, but not by a strategic long-term approach.

**3. Arctic Council Breakdown**

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the seven other members of the Arctic Council refused to attend any meetings chaired by Russia. China subsequently declared it saw no point in excluding Russia and suspended its own participation in the organization. China's Arctic envoy Gao Feng publicly sided with Moscow, warning that Beijing could not recognize an Arctic Council composed solely of the Arctic Seven.

This breakdown in Arctic governance would likely become permanent following U.S. annexation of Greenland, with Russia and China forming alternative governance frameworks while Western nations maintain their own Arctic cooperation mechanisms.

### Impact on Arctic Militarization and Security Environment

**1. Escalating Security Dilemma**

Arctic NATO countries and Russia are both increasingly perceiving militarization by the other side as aggressive, and militarization on their own part as defensive. This dynamic is creating an emerging cycle of mounting military capacity building and defense exercises that risk further deteriorating NATO countries' already fraught relationship with Russia at best, and military confrontation at worst.

U.S. annexation of Greenland would dramatically accelerate this security dilemma:

- **NATO response**: On August 31, 2025, Norway and the U.K. signed a strategic partnership agreement that includes the purchase of at least five frigates to better counter Russia on NATO's northern flank, valued at almost $14 billion. U.S. control of Greenland would likely trigger additional Allied Arctic military investments.

- **Russian overextension**: Russia's overextension in Ukraine inadvertently granted NATO a window of conventional military advantage in the Arctic, which will stay open so long as Russia's specialized Arctic brigades remain depleted. However, nuclear forces remain at full readiness.

- **Miscalculation risks**: The presence of armies heightens the already contentious dynamic in the region by allowing for the possibility of miscalculation. Although the risk of intentional military escalation might be apparent, the possibility of accidental conflict escalation in the region also remains a looming threat.

**2. Conflict Scenarios and Escalation Risks**

While military experts largely agree that the Arctic is unlikely to be the starting point for a great power war, there is growing consensus that any broader conflict involving major powers could quickly extend into the region:

- **Horizontal escalation**: Russia's regional military posture is increasing risks linked to horizontal escalation to and from the Arctic theater to regional theaters of operation. The situation is fraught with miscalculation and tactical errors that could lead to dangerous escalation with global consequences.

- **Nuclear dimension**: The increase in competition between the three great powers involves a nuclear rivalry—essentially, a nuclear security dilemma—as well as Arctic interests that span the cooperative, to competitive, to potentially conflictual dimension. A looming missile crisis in the Arctic presents significant escalation risks.

**3. Freedom of Navigation Disputes**

Russia and the U.S. have fundamental disagreements over the legal status of Arctic waters:

- **Northern Sea Route dispute**: Russia considers most of the NSR straits to be internal waters, while the United States holds that they are used for international navigation and subject to the regime of transit passage. In December 2022, Putin signed into law a measure designed to restrict navigation by foreign warships in sections of Russia's Arctic waters.

- **FONOP risks**: U.S. officials have threatened to send U.S. naval vessels in a Freedom of Navigation Operation (FONOP). The blowback from a potential FONOP could be frightening, with the potential to turn the Arctic into the new South China Sea.

- **Chinese interests**: China is working with Russia to develop the NSR as China sees the route as important for its national economic interests. Beijing has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," claiming rights to freedom of navigation and overflight, scientific research, fishing, and resource development.

### Effects on Great Power Competition

**1. NATO Alliance Damage**

Paradoxically, U.S. annexation would severely damage the very alliance it purports to strengthen:

- **Credibility destruction**: Greenlandic and European leaders strongly condemned the United States' statements on acquiring Greenland. It is hard to see how the alliance would recover from a treaty breach as shocking as one ally attacking another to seize territory. Changes to U.S. policy under President Trump already risk undermining the credibility of the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article 5 guarantee.

- **Playing into Putin's hands**: A U.S. armed invasion of Greenland would be doubly bad for Europe by playing into Putin's hands in Ukraine. "The idea that larger powers can have a free hand in what they regard as their own back yard is very much to Russia's taste," potentially handing Moscow the greatest gift the Trump administration has yet offered.

- **European realignment**: A turbulent and contentious Greenlandic independence push would greatly benefit U.S. adversaries and could lead to European nations seeking independent security arrangements or deeper ties with each other excluding the U.S.

**2. Precedent Effects on Other Territorial Disputes**

**South China Sea**: China would cite U.S. annexation as justification for its own territorial expansion. Russia's approach to the South China Sea dispute shows the interconnection: Moscow officially maintains a neutral position but has argued against interference by outside powers. The precedent set by China in not accepting the 2016 arbitration ruling could prove useful for Russia in its own territorial disputes, and U.S. annexation of Greenland would provide similar justification for both powers.

**Taiwan**: China would argue that if the U.S. can forcibly acquire territory from an ally, China's claims over Taiwan—which it considers part of China under UN Resolution 2758—are even more legitimate under international law.

**Russian near abroad**: Russia would feel emboldened to press claims in former Soviet territories, arguing that great power spheres of influence are the new norm, as indicated by the assessment that "American control over Panama, Cuba, Venezuela and Greenland is part of 19th century great power politics: the most powerful gets to rule in its immediate vicinity, in the same way that Russia wants to control what happens in Estonia, Ukraine and Moldova, and China in Vietnam, Mongolia and Taiwan."

**3. Resource Competition Intensification**

Greenland's rich natural resources, including oil, gas, and rare earth minerals, add to its strategic importance:

- **Rare earth leverage**: China leverages its domination of the rare earth industry to exert pressure on the U.S. These minerals are crucial to the global economy since they are required to manufacture everything from electric cars and wind turbines to military equipment.

- **Arctic energy**: Western sanctions fail to halt Russian Arctic energy projects, as China's support raises questions about sanction effectiveness in the region. China is providing much of the capital and technology that Russia needs to modernize infrastructure, build a new generation of Arctic-capable shipping, and make the NSR into a viable East-West corridor.

- **Climate change acceleration**: As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that could be exploited by China and Russia, intensifying competition for control of these strategic pathways.

### Assessment of Escalation Risks

**Low probability of direct military conflict over Greenland itself**: Despite Trump's claims that "if we don't do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland," vessel tracking data from maritime data and intelligence websites such as MarineTraffic do not show the presence of Chinese or Russian ships near Greenland. Experts emphasize that shared strategic interests and skillful diplomatic efforts between the United States, Greenland, and Denmark have already boxed out Russia and China from the territory.

**High probability of indirect escalation through**:
1. Accelerated Arctic militarization by all parties
2. Breakdown of remaining Arctic governance and cooperation mechanisms
3. Increased frequency and scope of military exercises and close encounters
4. Enhanced Russia-China military coordination despite mutual distrust
5. Heightened risks of miscalculation and accidental conflict
6. Spillover effects to other theaters (Europe, Indo-Pacific)

**Moderate probability of diplomatic and economic retaliation**:
1. Russian countersanctions and restrictions on Arctic cooperation
2. Chinese economic pressure through rare earth export controls
3. Coordinated diplomatic campaigns in the UN and other international forums
4. Support for separatist movements or political instability in U.S. allies
5. Cyber operations and information warfare campaigns

## Confidence

**High confidence** in the assessment of likely Russian and Chinese strategic responses based on:

1. **Strong recent precedent**: Putin's actual statements and Russia's observed behavior regarding Trump's 2025 Greenland threats provide direct evidence of Russian strategy
2. **Established patterns**: Both countries have demonstrated consistent approaches to Arctic strategy, territorial disputes, and alliance dynamics over multiple years
3. **Expert consensus**: Multiple think tanks (CSIS, RAND, Carnegie Endowment, CEPA) and government analyses converge on similar assessments
4. **Observable actions**: Recent military exercises, diplomatic statements, and infrastructure investments provide concrete evidence of strategic priorities

**Medium confidence** in specific escalation scenarios due to:

1. **Unpredictability of crisis dynamics**: The unprecedented nature of a U.S. ally annexing another ally's territory creates uncertainty about exact responses
2. **Trump administration variability**: Inconsistent U.S. policy execution could alter the strategic calculation for both Russia and China
3. **Internal political factors**: Domestic pressures in Russia, China, and European nations could shift responses in unexpected directions

## Caveats

1. **Hypothetical scenario**: This analysis assumes an actual U.S. annexation attempt occurs, which remains highly uncertain given strong international and domestic opposition.

2. **Current defense arrangements already address concerns**: Experts note that controlling all of Greenland isn't necessary to accomplish U.S. national security goals, pointing to the existing 1951 defense treaty between the U.S. and Denmark. U.S. diplomatic pressure and coordination between Washington and Copenhagen already fended off Chinese bids to build airports and acquire an abandoned Danish naval base in 2018.

3. **Russia-China coordination limits**: While both countries would exploit U.S. annexation for strategic advantage, fundamental differences in their Arctic approaches, mutual distrust, and competing relationships with other Arctic powers would limit truly coordinated responses.

4. **Ukraine conflict variable**: Russia's continued overextension in Ukraine significantly limits its conventional military capacity for Arctic escalation, though nuclear forces remain fully capable.

5. **Economic constraints**: Western sanctions already constrain Russian Arctic development, and Chinese fear of secondary sanctions limits economic support for Russian projects. These constraints would continue to operate regardless of Greenland's status.

6. **Time horizons differ**: Russian responses would be immediate and opportunistic, while Chinese responses would focus on long-term strategic positioning and precedent-setting rather than short-term military reactions.

7. **NATO's paradoxical position**: The greatest strategic benefit to Russia and China comes not from directly opposing U.S. annexation, but from the severe damage it would inflict on NATO cohesion and U.S. credibility—making direct confrontation less necessary.
