# Analysis: Legal Feasibility of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Problem Understanding

The question asks about the legal mechanisms and barriers for the United States to acquire Greenland under international law. This requires examining:

1. Modern international law on territorial acquisition
2. Greenland's unique legal status within the Kingdom of Denmark
3. Principles of self-determination
4. Historical precedents for territorial transfers
5. Denmark's legal authority to transfer Greenland
6. Applicable treaties and international norms

## Why I Chose to SOLVE

This is a focused legal research question that can be answered directly through:
- Reviewing international law frameworks (UN Charter, ICJ cases, treaties)
- Examining Greenland's constitutional status within Denmark
- Analyzing relevant precedents and scholarly sources
- Synthesizing legal requirements and barriers

While complex, this doesn't require decomposition - it requires thorough legal research.

## Research Plan

1. **International Law Framework**: Search for current international law on territorial acquisition, sovereignty transfers, and self-determination (2026)

2. **Greenland's Legal Status**: Research Greenland's constitutional relationship with Denmark, including the 2009 Self-Government Act

3. **Self-Determination Principles**: Examine UN principles and how they apply to Greenland

4. **Historical Precedents**: Review relevant territorial transfers (Alaska, Virgin Islands, etc.)

5. **Legal Mechanisms**: Identify what legal processes would be required

6. **Expert Analysis**: Look for scholarly and expert opinions on this specific scenario
