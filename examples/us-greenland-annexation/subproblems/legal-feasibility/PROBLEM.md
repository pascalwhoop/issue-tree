# Sub-Problem: Legal Feasibility of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Question
Under international law and relevant legal frameworks, what mechanisms exist for the United States to acquire Greenland, and what legal barriers or requirements would apply?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the legal dimension of the parent question: "Should the United States annex Greenland?"

Greenland's legal status is complex:
- Autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark
- Denmark handles foreign affairs and defense
- Greenland has internal self-governance
- Historical precedent of territorial purchases (Louisiana, Alaska)
- Modern international law on self-determination and sovereignty

Understanding legal feasibility is a threshold question - if acquisition is legally impossible or would violate international law, that constrains the parent analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Identifies applicable international law (UN Charter, self-determination principles, etc.)
- Examines legal mechanisms for territorial acquisition in modern international law
- Analyzes Greenland's unique legal status within Denmark
- Reviews historical precedents for territorial transfers
- Assesses Denmark's legal authority to transfer Greenland
- Evaluates Greenland's right to self-determination under international law
- Provides clear conclusion on legal pathways and barriers
