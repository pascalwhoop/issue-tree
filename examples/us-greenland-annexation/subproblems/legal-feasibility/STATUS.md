Completed comprehensive legal analysis of U.S. acquisition of Greenland under international law.

## Work Completed:
- Researched modern international law frameworks on territorial acquisition
- Analyzed Greenland's unique legal status under 2009 Self-Government Act
- Examined self-determination principles and jus cogens norms
- Reviewed historical precedents for territorial transfers
- Assessed Denmark's legal authority and constitutional requirements
- Identified legal mechanisms and barriers

## Key Finding:
Legal acquisition is theoretically possible through voluntary cession with full consent from Greenland (via referendum), Denmark (via parliament), and the United States (via constitutional process). However, any use of force or coercion would violate fundamental international law principles and render any agreement void.
