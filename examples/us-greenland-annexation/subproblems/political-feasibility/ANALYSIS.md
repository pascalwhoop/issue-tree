# Analysis: Political Feasibility of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Problem Understanding

This sub-problem addresses the political dimension of whether the United States should annex Greenland. Even if legally and economically viable, territorial acquisition requires political will and agreement from multiple sovereign parties.

## Why SOLVE (Not Decompose)

This problem can be answered directly through comprehensive research on:
- Recent political statements and positions from U.S., Danish, and Greenlandic officials
- Public opinion in all three jurisdictions
- Constitutional/procedural requirements
- Historical context of recent proposals

While there are multiple stakeholders, they can be addressed in a single integrated analysis rather than requiring separate sub-problems.
