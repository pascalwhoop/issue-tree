# Sub-Problem: Political Feasibility of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Question
What is the political likelihood and willingness from the United States, Denmark, and Greenland for U.S. annexation of Greenland?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the political dimension of the parent question: "Should the United States annex Greenland?"

Even if legally possible, territorial acquisition requires political will and agreement from multiple parties:
- **U.S. perspective**: Political support, Congressional approval, public opinion
- **Danish perspective**: Government position, public sentiment, constitutional requirements
- **Greenlandic perspective**: Self-governance authorities, public opinion, independence movement dynamics

Recent history includes public statements from U.S. political figures about purchasing Greenland and strong rejections from Danish and Greenlandic leaders.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Assesses current U.S. political interest and domestic feasibility
- Evaluates Danish government position and domestic political constraints
- Analyzes Greenlandic government position and public sentiment
- Examines the role of Greenland's independence movement
- Reviews recent political statements and proposals
- Considers constitutional/procedural requirements in each jurisdiction
- Provides realistic assessment of political likelihood
