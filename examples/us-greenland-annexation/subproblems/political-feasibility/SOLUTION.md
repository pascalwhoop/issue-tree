# Solution: Political Feasibility of U.S. Acquisition of Greenland

## Answer

**The political likelihood of U.S. annexation of Greenland is extremely low to virtually impossible under current circumstances.** All three parties involved—the United States, Denmark, and Greenland—demonstrate significant political obstacles that make voluntary acquisition highly improbable:

- **U.S. Domestic Support**: Minimal public support (only 11-19% approval) and divided political leadership, with key Congressional leaders opposing the use of force
- **Danish Position**: Absolute and unequivocal rejection by government and public, with warnings that attempts would destroy NATO
- **Greenlandic Position**: Overwhelming rejection of U.S. control (85% opposed), with clear preference for independence over either Danish or American sovereignty

Even if the U.S. pursued diplomatic purchase negotiations, both Denmark and Greenland have constitutional and legal mechanisms that would require their consent, which is clearly absent.

## Evidence

### 1. United States Political Landscape

**Executive Branch Position (2025-2026)**

President Trump renewed his interest in acquiring Greenland in late 2024/early 2025, with escalating rhetoric. The White House stated that "all options" are on the table, and Trump said the U.S. would take Greenland "the hard way" if it couldn't do it "the easy way." Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urged Europeans to support the plan, while Vice President JD Vance defended the administration's interest.

Republican Congressman Randy Fine introduced the "Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act" to support Trump's plan, citing "America's strategic national security interests in the Arctic."

**Congressional Opposition**

Despite some support from Trump allies, significant bipartisan Congressional opposition exists:

- **Speaker Mike Johnson** disagreed with military intervention, stating "I don't think anybody's seriously considering that. And in the Congress, we're certainly not," though he expressed belief that annexation is "in America's interest"
- **Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell** criticized the approach, calling threats "unseemly" and "counterproductive," warning that using force "would be an especially catastrophic act of strategic self-harm"
- **Bipartisan Statement from Senators Thom Tillis and Jeanne Shaheen**: "When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations" and warned that coercion "undermines the very principles of self-determination"
- **Former National Security Advisor John Bolton** supported the objective but disagreed with Trump's approach

**American Public Opinion**

Multiple polls show limited public support for acquiring Greenland:

- USA Today poll (January 7-10, 2025): Only **11% of Americans** said Trump should purchase or annex Greenland
- Yahoo News survey (1,677 adults): **49% opposed** annexation of Greenland
- University of Maryland poll (1,000+ adults): **49% opposed** while only **19% favored** annexation
- YouGov poll: Only **about one-quarter of Americans** would support purchasing Greenland
- Military force opposition: **73% of Americans opposed** using force to take control, with only **8% favoring** military seizure
- YouGov (August 2025): Just **7% of U.S. adults** supported using force to annex Greenland, with **72% opposed**

Even among Republicans, support is limited: Just **8% of Republicans "strongly" favored** getting Denmark to turn over Greenland (Reuters poll, January 2025).

**Constitutional Requirements**

U.S. territorial acquisition requires Congressional action. The Constitution's Admissions Clause (Article IV, Section 3) authorizes Congress to admit new states, while the Territorial Clause grants Congress plenary authority over territories. Treaties regarding territory exchange require presidential initiation and advice and consent of two-thirds of the U.S. Senate. Given the Congressional opposition and lack of public support, securing the necessary votes would be extremely difficult.

### 2. Danish Government Position

**Absolute Rejection**

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued clear and repeated rejections:

- "The United States has no right to annex territories of Denmark"
- Told the U.S. to "stop the threats" about taking over Greenland
- "It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the United States needing to take over Greenland"
- "You cannot annex another country"
- Warned that a U.S. takeover would mean "the end of NATO" and would be "the end of everything"

**Constitutional and Legal Framework**

Denmark lacks the legal authority to unilaterally cede or transfer Greenland. Under the Self-Government Act:

- If Greenlanders decide in favor of independence, negotiations must commence between the Danish Government and Naalakkersuisut (Greenland's government)
- Any agreement regarding independence must be:
  - Concluded with consent of Inatsisartut (Greenland's parliament)
  - Endorsed by a referendum in Greenland
  - Concluded with consent of the Folketing (Danish parliament) per Section 19 of the Danish Constitution

Any change in sovereignty requires amendments to Denmark's constitutional framework and explicit consent from both Greenland's elected government and population through referendum.

**European Support for Denmark**

Denmark received strong backing from European allies. Leaders from seven European countries (Germany, Spain, France, Poland, the U.K., Italy, and Denmark) released a joint statement: "It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland."

**Historical Context**

While Denmark did sell the Danish West Indies (now U.S. Virgin Islands) to the United States in 1917, that situation was fundamentally different. The West Indies were seen as "little more than an investment object" without meaningful cultural or political connections. Greenland has deep historical and cultural ties to Denmark, making any sale politically impossible.

Denmark's rejection in 2019 was similarly absolute. When Trump first floated the idea publicly, the Danish prime minister called it "absurd," leading Trump to cancel a scheduled diplomatic visit, which Danes perceived as a grave insult.

### 3. Greenlandic Position

**Overwhelming Rejection of U.S. Control**

Greenlandic public opinion shows clear opposition to becoming part of the United States:

- Verian poll (January 22-26, 2025): **85% of Greenlanders do not want to leave the Realm and become part of the United States**, while only **6% want to join the U.S.**, with 9% undecided

**Government Position**

Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen forcefully rejected U.S. proposals:

- When Trump said "we need Greenland" and linked it to military intervention, Nielsen stated: "It's not just wrong. It's disrespectful"
- "Our country is not something that can be annexed or taken over because you feel like it"
- "Greenland is not for sale" (consistent message with Denmark)

In January 2026, Nielsen and four party leaders issued a joint statement: **"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders."**

In 2019, Greenlanders famously responded to Trump's initial proposal: **"We're open for business, not for sale."**

**The Independence Movement**

Greenland has a strong independence movement, but it seeks independence from both Denmark AND avoidance of U.S. control:

- Multiple polls show **56-84% support for independence from Denmark** if a referendum were held
- However, support is conditional: **61% opposed independence if it meant a lower standard of living** (with 39% in favor), and **45% do not want independence if their standard of living is negatively affected**
- All Greenlandic political parties support independence in principle but differ on timing and methodology

**Key Challenge**: Greenland receives approximately $500 million in annual subsidies and economic support from Copenhagen, creating financial dependency that complicates independence aspirations.

**Self-Determination Rights**

Under international law and the Self-Government Act, Greenland has the right to self-determination. Any transfer of sovereignty requires:

- Free consent of the Greenlandic people through referendum
- Agreement by Greenland's parliament (Inatsisartut)
- Respect for indigenous rights and self-determination principles

Legal experts note that "the right of self-determination would be violated if Denmark ceded Greenland to the United States without popular support in Greenland in favor of such a transfer of territorial title."

**Possible Pathways (All Highly Unlikely)**

The only theoretically lawful pathway would be:

1. Greenland votes for independence from Denmark
2. An independent Greenland then chooses to join the United States through free association or statehood

However, given that 85% of Greenlanders oppose U.S. control, this scenario is extremely improbable. As legal analysis notes, "under the present constitutional arrangement, Greenland could not instantly swap the US for Denmark as their sovereign."

### 4. Recent Political History (2019 Precedent)

Trump's 2019 proposal to purchase Greenland provides clear historical precedent for the current situation:

**The Proposal**: Trump first publicly expressed interest in buying Greenland in 2019, likening it to a "large real estate deal." Reports indicate he discussed acquiring Greenland as early as 2017, with Senator Tom Cotton proposing the idea to the Danish ambassador in August 2018.

**The Rejection**: Both Danish and Greenlandic authorities quickly and soundly rejected the proposal. Danish PM Frederiksen called the idea "absurd," leading Trump to call her statement "nasty" and "inappropriate."

**Diplomatic Fallout**: Trump canceled his scheduled state visit to Denmark just 14 days before it was to occur, which Danes perceived as a grave insult. Danish politicians reacted with outrage. The offer was seen as not only ridiculous but insulting to both Greenland and Denmark.

The 2019 episode demonstrates that the fundamental positions of all three parties have remained consistent, with Denmark and Greenland firmly rejecting any sale and viewing such proposals as offensive to their sovereignty and self-determination.

## Confidence

**High Confidence** in the assessment that political feasibility is extremely low.

This confidence is based on:

1. **Multiple independent data sources**: Public opinion polls from reputable organizations (USA Today, YouGov, University of Maryland, Verian) showing consistent patterns
2. **Direct statements from government officials**: Clear, public positions from Danish PM, Greenlandic PM, U.S. Congressional leaders
3. **Constitutional and legal framework**: Well-established legal requirements in both Denmark and Greenland requiring consent
4. **Historical precedent**: 2019 proposal received identical rejection with similar reasoning
5. **International law consensus**: Legal scholars agree on self-determination requirements
6. **Consistent messaging across time**: Positions have remained stable from 2019 to 2026

The only uncertainty is whether U.S. political will might shift significantly, but current data shows strong opposition even among the American public.

## Caveats

1. **Dramatic Circumstance Changes**: An extraordinary shift in geopolitical circumstances (e.g., major security crisis in the Arctic, dramatic change in Greenlandic economic situation) could theoretically alter political calculations, though current evidence suggests even this would face massive obstacles.

2. **Long-Term Independence Scenario**: If Greenland achieves independence from Denmark over the next decade or more, and if economic circumstances change dramatically, a future independent Greenland government might theoretically reconsider relationships with external powers. However, current polling shows 85% opposition to U.S. control, making even this distant scenario unlikely.

3. **Forced Acquisition**: This analysis addresses voluntary, legal acquisition. The U.S. could theoretically attempt forced annexation, but this would:
   - Violate international law and NATO treaty obligations
   - Face massive domestic U.S. political opposition (73% oppose force)
   - Destroy U.S. alliances and international standing
   - Be condemned as illegitimate by the international community
   - Face armed resistance potentially triggering Article 5 NATO collective defense
   - This option is considered outside the bounds of politically feasible democratic governance

4. **Polling Limitations**: Public opinion can shift, though the consistency across multiple polls and over time (2019-2026) suggests stability. Question wording and sampling methodology can affect results, but the magnitude of opposition (70-85% against) leaves little room for interpretation variance.

5. **Congressional Composition Changes**: Future U.S. elections could theoretically produce a Congress more aligned with annexation, but the current bipartisan opposition and low public support (11-19%) suggest this would require extraordinary political realignment.

6. **Greenlandic Financial Dependency**: Greenland's economic reliance on Danish subsidies (~$500 million annually) is a significant constraint on independence and could theoretically make economic offers more attractive. However, current polling shows Greenlanders are wary of independence if it lowers living standards, and there's no evidence they view U.S. control as a solution to this challenge.
