# Analysis: Self-Determination and Indigenous Rights

## Problem Understanding

This sub-problem examines the ethical and human rights dimensions of potential U.S. annexation of Greenland, specifically focusing on:
- Greenlandic self-determination rights
- Indigenous Inuit rights under international law
- Current self-governance status and aspirations
- Public opinion and political preferences in Greenland
- Historical context of colonialism and territorial transfers

## Why SOLVE Instead of DECOMPOSE

This problem can be addressed directly through comprehensive research on:
1. International legal frameworks (UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples, self-determination principles)
2. Greenland's current political status and self-governance
3. Greenlandic public opinion and political sentiment
4. Historical precedents for indigenous peoples in territorial transfers
5. Ethical frameworks for evaluating sovereignty questions

While multi-faceted, these aspects are interconnected and best analyzed together to provide a cohesive ethical assessment.

1. **International Legal Framework**
   - UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)
   - Self-determination in international law

   - Views on U.S. annexation
   - Political party positions
   - Statements from Greenlandic leaders

4. **Indigenous Rights Context**

   - Historical colonialism in Greenland

   - Comparison to other indigenous territorial situations

5. **Ethical Framework**
   - Consent-based vs. imposed sovereignty changes
   - Indigenous self-determination as human right
   - Paternalism and neocolonialism concerns
