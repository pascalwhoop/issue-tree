# Sub-Problem: Self-Determination and Indigenous Rights

## Question
How does potential U.S. annexation align with Greenlandic self-determination and indigenous Inuit rights?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the ethical and human rights dimension of the parent question: "Should the United States annex Greenland?"

Key considerations:
- Greenland's population is ~56,000, approximately 90% indigenous Inuit
- Greenland has achieved significant self-governance from Denmark
- Active independence movement seeking full sovereignty
- International law on indigenous peoples' rights (UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples)
- Principle of self-determination in international law
- Historical context of colonialism and indigenous peoples
- Greenlandic cultural identity and political agency

This is fundamentally about whether external powers should determine Greenland's future without Greenlandic consent.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Examines Greenland's current self-governance and aspirations
- Analyzes indigenous rights frameworks in international law
- Evaluates principle of self-determination as applied to Greenland
- Assesses Greenlandic public opinion and political preferences
- Considers historical context of indigenous peoples and territorial transfers
- Examines whether U.S. acquisition could occur WITH Greenlandic consent
- Evaluates ethical implications of annexation against or without Greenlandic will
- Provides clear ethical framework for evaluating the question
