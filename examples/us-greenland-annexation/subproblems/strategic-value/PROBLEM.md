# Sub-Problem: Strategic and Military Value of Greenland to the U.S.

## Question
What strategic and military benefits would the United States gain from controlling Greenland?

## Context
This sub-problem addresses the strategic rationale dimension of the parent question: "Should the United States annex Greenland?"

Key strategic considerations:
- Arctic access and control as climate change opens new routes
- Military positioning relative to Russia and China
- Existing U.S. military presence (Thule Air Base/Pituffik Space Base)
- Early warning systems and missile defense
- Control of Arctic shipping lanes
- Strategic resources and rare earth minerals
- Geopolitical competition in the Arctic region

Understanding strategic value is essential to evaluating whether acquisition would serve U.S. national security interests.

## Acceptance Criteria
A comprehensive answer that:
- Evaluates current U.S. military presence and capabilities in Greenland
- Assesses Arctic geopolitical importance in current security environment
- Analyzes military and intelligence value (bases, surveillance, missile defense)
- Examines control over Arctic shipping routes and airspace
- Considers competition with Russia and China in the Arctic
- Evaluates whether current arrangements (NATO, existing base agreements) provide sufficient strategic access
- Quantifies incremental strategic benefit of full sovereignty vs. current status
