# Analysis

## Problem Understanding

This is a significant life decision for a Head of Engineering at Evercure, comparing two cities: Zurich (potential move) vs Amsterdam (current location). The decision involves:

- German national with Italian partner
- 1-3 years in Amsterdam (established but not deeply rooted)
- No property purchased yet, no children yet
- Key priorities: Lifestyle/culture > Family/relationships > Cost of living
- Primary driver: Financial reasons
- Core values: Brilliant people in life sciences/medical/healthcare, sports/outdoors community

## Decision: DECOMPOSE

**Why Decompose?**

This problem cannot be answered directly without first answering multiple constituent questions. The decision requires:

1. Different research methodologies for different aspects (financial analysis, lifestyle research, career assessment)
2. Independent analysis of multiple factors that each deserve thorough investigation
3. Synthesis of diverse information sources (tax data, cost of living, community research, career opportunities)
4. Addressing both quantitative (finances, costs) and qualitative (culture, relationships) dimensions

**Sub-Problems Identified (MECE Framework)**

Following the Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive principle:

1. **Financial Analysis** - Comprehensive comparison of financial implications
2. **Career & Professional Network** - Opportunities in healthcare/life sciences, professional community quality
3. **Lifestyle & Culture** - Sports/outdoors culture, social environment, values alignment
4. **Partner Impact** - Specific considerations for Italian partner
5. **Long-term Quality of Life** - Future planning, children, healthcare, education, stability

**How Sub-Problems Contribute**

- **Financial Analysis**: Addresses the primary driver and one of top 3 priorities
- **Career & Professional Network**: Critical for value of being around brilliant people in healthcare/life sciences
- **Lifestyle & Culture**: Top priority - addresses sports/outdoors and cultural fit
- **Partner Impact**: Top 3 priority (family/relationships) - Italian partner's experience is crucial
- **Long-term Quality of Life**: Ensures decision accounts for future planning and stability

Each sub-problem can be researched and analyzed independently, then synthesized into a final recommendation.
