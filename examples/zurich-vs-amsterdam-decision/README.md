# Problem Tree: Zurich vs Amsterdam Decision

## Root Problem

Should I (Head of Engineering at Evercure) relocate from Amsterdam to Zurich, or remain in Amsterdam?

This is a personal life decision considering financial benefits, lifestyle alignment, career opportunities, partner situation, and future planning.

## Structure

This is a recursive problem-solving tree. Each node can either:
- Be decomposed into sub-problems (creates subproblems/ folder)
- Be solved directly (creates SOLUTION.md)

## Files

- `PROBLEM.md` - The problem/question at this node
- `STATUS.md` - Current status (pending/decomposed/solving/solved)
- `ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis and reasoning (created by solver)
- `SOLUTION.md` - The answer (created when solved)
- `subproblems/` - Child problem nodes (if decomposed)

## Usage

To work on this problem tree:

```bash
cd zurich-vs-amsterdam-decision

# Then invoke the solve-node skill:
/solve-node
```

## Current Status

See STATUS.md for current state.
