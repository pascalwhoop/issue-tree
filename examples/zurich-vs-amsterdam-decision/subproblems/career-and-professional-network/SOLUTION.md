### 8. Alignment with Core Values

**User's stated values:**
> "Being surrounded by brilliant people doing meaningful work in life sciences, medical research, and healthcare research"

**Zurich:**
- ✅ Highest global density of life sciences companies
- ✅ World-leading pharma R&D happening here (Roche, Novartis, etc.)
- ✅ ETH Zurich bringing cutting-edge engineering + medical research
- ✅ $3.2B in R&D investment annually
- ✅ Nobel laureates, world-class scientists physically present
- ✅ Multiple major breakthroughs originating here

**Amsterdam:**
- ✅ Strong clinical research at Amsterdam UMC
- ✅ Growing healthtech/digital health scene
- ✅ Good academic research environment
- ⚠️ Smaller overall ecosystem
- ⚠️ Fewer "household name" life sciences companies
- ⚠️ More diffuse across Netherlands rather than concentrated

**Winner: Zurich** - Better alignment with desire to be "surrounded by brilliant people doing meaningful work" in life sciences

### 9. Remote Work Considerations

**For Evercure (current employer):**
- If remote work is significant part of role, location matters less
- However, local ecosystem still important for:
  - Professional network building
  - Future job opportunities
  - Inspiration and learning from local community
  - Potential customers/partners for Evercure

**Assessment**: Even with remote work, Zurich's ecosystem provides more value through proximity to potential collaborators, customers, and future opportunities

## Confidence

**High (90%)**

**Strengths:**
- Multiple authoritative sources on ecosystem size and composition
- Clear quantitative differences in company density, funding, R&D investment
- Well-documented research institution rankings
- Consistent findings across multiple sources

**Limitations:**
- Evercure's specific needs and remote work policy not fully known
- Subjective assessment of "brilliant people" and "meaningful work"
- Both ecosystems are growing; 2026-2030 trajectories may differ
- Personal network effects (existing Amsterdam connections) not quantified

## Caveats

1. **Current Amsterdam network**: You've been in Amsterdam 1-3 years and have established connections. Moving to Zurich means starting professional network from scratch (though German language helps).

2. **Evercure location**: If Evercure has Amsterdam presence/customers, staying might offer internal career advantages.

3. **"Meaningful work" definition**: If your definition emphasizes clinical care/patient outcomes over drug discovery/technology, Amsterdam UMC might be more appealing.

4. **Ecosystem growth**: Amsterdam's ecosystem is younger and growing faster (in percentage terms). The gap might narrow over time.

5. **English vs German**: Amsterdam is fully English-functional. Zurich is too, but German helps significantly for deeper integration into the professional community.

6. **Conference travel**: Both cities are hubs, but Zurich's proximity to Basel (Roche, Novartis HQs) and central European location provides easy access to other major life sciences centers.

## Career & Network Recommendation

**Zurich is clearly superior** for someone who wants to be "surrounded by brilliant people doing meaningful work in life sciences, medical research, and healthcare research."

**Zurich advantages:**
- 1,000+ life sciences companies vs distributed ecosystem
- Global pharma/biotech HQ concentration
- ETH Zurich engineering excellence + life sciences focus
- $3.2B annual R&D investment in immediate area
- Established professional networks and frequent industry events
- Multiple career paths within deep life sciences job market
- German language advantage for network building

**Amsterdam advantages:**
- Existing 1-3 year network and relationships
- Excellent clinical research at Amsterdam UMC
- Fully English-functional environment
- Growing startup scene (may prefer scrappier environment)
- European Medicines Agency presence (regulatory angle)

**Recommendation**:
If career growth, intellectual stimulation, and being at the center of life sciences innovation are priorities, **Zurich is the clear choice**. The density of "brilliant people doing meaningful work" is simply unmatched in Europe outside of Basel/Zurich and Cambridge UK.

**Action items:**
- Assess Evercure's geographic strategy and remote work policy
- Consider visiting Zurich to attend Life Science Zurich Impact Conference (May 2025) or similar events
- Reach out to life sciences engineering professionals in both cities on LinkedIn
- Evaluate whether starting professional network from scratch is acceptable trade-off
