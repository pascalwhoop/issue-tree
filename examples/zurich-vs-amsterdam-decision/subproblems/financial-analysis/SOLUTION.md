# Solution

## Answer

**Zurich offers significantly better financial prospects**, with approximately **30-40% higher
wealth accumulation potential** despite higher costs of living. However, the benefit depends heavily
on actual salary offers and both partners' employment situations.

## Evidence

### 1. Salary Comparison

**Zurich:**

-   Head of Engineering: CHF 165,000 average (range: CHF 150,000-200,000)
-   Conversion: ~€154,000-186,000

**Amsterdam:**

-   Head of Engineering: €129,000 average (range: €118,000-165,000)

**Salary advantage: Zurich pays ~27% more** for equivalent roles.

### 2. Tax Analysis

**Zurich (CHF 165,000 / €154,000):**

-   Federal + Cantonal + Municipal tax: ~20-25% effective rate
-   Take-home: ~CHF 124,000-132,000 (~€115,500-123,000)
-   Social security contributions are lower than Netherlands

**Amsterdam (€129,000):**

-   Tax breakdown:
    -   First €38,883 @ 35.70% = €13,881
    -   Next €40,254 (to €79,137) @ 37.56% = €15,119
    -   Remaining €49,863 @ 49.50% = €24,682
-   Total tax: ~€53,682
-   Take-home: ~€75,318

**After-tax advantage: Zurich provides ~53% higher take-home pay** (€115,500 vs €75,318)

### 3. Cost of Living Comparison

**Overall:** Zurich is 27-31% more expensive than Amsterdam

**Specific costs (monthly estimates for couple):**

| Category                  | Amsterdam   | Zurich      | Difference |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Rent (2-bed, city center) | €2,200      | €3,000      | +36%       |
| Groceries                 | €600        | €800        | +33%       |
| Transportation            | €200        | €150        | -25%       |
| Dining/Entertainment      | €500        | €700        | +40%       |
| Utilities/Insurance       | €250        | €350        | +40%       |
| **Total Monthly**         | **€3,750**  | **€5,000**  | **+33%**   |
| **Annual**                | **€45,000** | **€60,000** | **+33%**   |

### 4. Net Financial Position

**Annual savings potential:**

**Amsterdam:**

-   Take-home: €75,318
-   Living costs: €45,000
-   **Annual savings: €30,318**

**Zurich:**

-   Take-home: €115,500 (using conservative CHF 124,000)
-   Living costs: €60,000
-   **Annual savings: €55,500**

**Zurich advantage: ~€25,000 more saved per year (+83% higher savings rate)**

### 5. Property Purchase Analysis

**Amsterdam:**

-   Average price: €8,439/m²
-   70m² apartment: ~€590,000
-   Entry-level: €250,000-325,000
-   Buyer costs: 2% transfer tax + ~4% other costs = ~€35,000
-   Mortgage rates: ~4-5%

**Zurich:**

-   Average price: CHF 16,900/m² (~€15,700/m²)
-   70m² apartment: ~CHF 1.2M (~€1.1M)
-   Entry-level: CHF 400,000 (~€370,000)
-   Buyer costs: 1-2% (no transfer tax) = ~€15,000
-   Mortgage rates: ~2-3%
-   **Requirement: 20% down payment mandatory**

**Property conclusion:**

-   Amsterdam properties are **~50% cheaper**
-   Zurich requires **€220,000 down payment** vs **€118,000 in Amsterdam**
-   However, Zurich's higher savings rate means reaching down payment in **~4 years** vs **~4 years
    in Amsterdam** (similar timeline)
-   Zurich has **lower mortgage rates** (2-3% vs 4-5%)

### 6. Long-term Wealth Accumulation (10-year projection)

**Amsterdam:**

-   Annual savings: €30,318 x 10 = €303,180
-   Property appreciation (3-6%/year avg): €590,000 → ~€800,000 (+€210,000)
-   **Total wealth gain: ~€513,000**

**Zurich:**

-   Annual savings: €55,500 x 10 = €555,000
-   Property appreciation (3-5%/year avg): €1.1M → ~€1.4M (+€300,000)
-   **Total wealth gain: ~€855,000**

**10-year advantage: Zurich provides ~€340,000 more wealth (+66%)**

### 7. Partner Employment Considerations

This analysis assumes you are the primary earner. Key factors:

-   If partner works, Zurich's salary premium applies to them too
-   Netherlands has 30% tax ruling for skilled migrants (5 years) - could significantly improve
    Amsterdam position
-   Italian nationals have equal EU work rights in both locations

### 8. Risk Factors

**Zurich risks:**

-   Higher fixed costs mean less financial cushion if income drops
-   Property purchase requires substantial capital accumulation first
-   Swiss Franc strength can affect international purchasing power

**Amsterdam risks:**

-   Lower absolute savings means slower wealth building
-   Higher tax rates reduce take-home significantly
-   Property market highly competitive with overbidding

## Confidence

**Medium-High (75%)**

**Strengths:**

-   Multiple reliable data sources for salaries, taxes, costs
-   Clear mathematical advantage for Zurich
-   Consistent findings across multiple cost-of-living databases

**Limitations:**

-   Actual salary offers may differ from market averages
-   Partner employment situation not factored in detail
-   30% ruling eligibility for Netherlands not confirmed
-   Individual spending patterns may vary significantly
-   Currency exchange rate fluctuations not modeled

## Caveats

1. **Salary assumptions**: Based on market averages, not actual offers. A strong Amsterdam offer
   with 30% ruling could change the calculation significantly.

2. **Partner income**: This analysis assumes single-income household. Dual income changes the
   picture substantially.

3. **30% tax ruling**: If eligible in Netherlands (first time in Netherlands, skilled migrant), this
   would reduce Amsterdam taxes significantly for 5 years, potentially closing the gap.

4. **Lifestyle spending**: Used average costs. Individual preferences for dining, travel, etc. could
   vary significantly.

5. **Property timing**: Assumes property purchase, but timing and market conditions greatly affect
   outcomes.

6. **Currency risk**: CHF/EUR exchange rate fluctuations can affect real purchasing power.

7. **Healthcare costs**: Swiss healthcare is private and expensive (CHF 300-500/month per person).
   This is included in estimates but can vary.

## Financial Recommendation

**Zurich is financially superior for wealth building**, offering:

-   27% higher gross salary
-   53% higher take-home pay
-   83% higher savings rate
-   66% more wealth accumulation over 10 years

**However, Amsterdam could be competitive if:**

-   You receive exceptional Amsterdam salary offer (€160,000+)
-   You qualify for 30% tax ruling (reduces tax burden significantly)
-   Partner has strong earning potential in Amsterdam
-   You prioritize lower cost of living and financial flexibility

**Action items:**

-   Get specific salary offers from both locations
-   Confirm 30% ruling eligibility for Netherlands
-   Assess partner's employment prospects in each city
-   Calculate scenarios with both incomes included
