# Analysis

## Problem Understanding

This is the TOP PRIORITY in the decision. Need to compare lifestyle fit, cultural environment, and alignment with values around sports/outdoors activities and social life. Must consider both the opportunity cost of leaving established Amsterdam life and the potential benefits of Zurich's offerings.

## Research Plan

1. **Sports & Outdoors**: Compare hiking, skiing, cycling, water sports, outdoor activity culture
2. **City Character**: Assess pace of life, social dynamics, international vs local feel
3. **Cultural Fit**: Evaluate Swiss vs Dutch culture for a German national
4. **Work-Life Balance**: Research typical working culture and leisure time
5. **Weather & Geography**: Compare climate, access to nature
6. **Social Integration**: Consider language, expat community, making friends
7. **Quality of Life Indices**: Review livability rankings and resident satisfaction

## Key Questions
- Which city better serves the value of sports/outdoors?
- Where will a German feel more at home culturally?
- What's the cost of leaving 1-3 years of Amsterdam connections?
- Which city's personality aligns better with stated values?
