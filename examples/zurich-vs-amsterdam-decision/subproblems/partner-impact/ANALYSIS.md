## Problem Understanding

Need to assess implications for Italian partner comparing Zurich vs Amsterdam. This is the 2nd priority (family & relationships), so partner's happiness and opportunities are critical to the decision.

## Research Plan

1. **Language environment**: Italian speakers in each city, ease of integration
2. **Work opportunities**: Job market for Italian nationals
3. **Italian community**: Size, support networks, cultural events
4. **Cultural fit**: Swiss vs Dutch culture from Italian perspective
5. **Geographic proximity**: Distance to Italy, flight connections, visiting family
6. **Visa/work permits**: Legal rights as EU/Italian national
7. **Quality of life**: Factors specific to Italian cultural preferences

## Key Questions
- Where will an Italian partner feel more at home?
- Which city offers better work opportunities?
- How important is proximity to Italy?
- Are there strong Italian communities in each city?
